Welcome to my blog, **Meta-Analysis Tricks**! Most posts will introduce a tricky method that you can use to extract those pesky, unreported statistics from primary studies. Other posts will pertain to lesser known meta-analysis methods that are often overlooked in practice. Posts will include code in R for easy implementation in your own meta-analysis.
