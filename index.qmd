I am a PhD student in Quantitative Psychology at the University of Connecticut. My research involves quantitative methods for meta-analysis and psychological measurement. Specifically, my current research projects focus on correcting bias in effect size estimates caused by statistical artifacts. My advisor is Dr. Blair T. Johnson and I am affiliated with the Systematic Health Action Research Program (SHARP). I am also on the editorial board for Psychological Bulletin as a methodological reviewer.
