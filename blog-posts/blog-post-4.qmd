## Defining a Squared Effect Size

Sometimes squared effect sizes are used in order to interpret results (e.g., $R^2$, $\eta^2$). Generally, lets say we have some observed effect size $h_i$ for a sample $i$. This can be modeled as a function of a population correlation $\theta$ and sampling error $e_i$,

$$
ES_i = \theta + e_i
$$
Where the expectation of $h_i$ (i.e., the average) upon repeated sampling is equal to $\theta$. More importantly for us, the expectation of sampling error $e_i$ across repeated samples would be zero. For the expectation of $e_i$ to be zero, $e$ would need to be randomly distributed around zero with both positive and negative values. Let us see what happens to the model once we square both sides to obtain $h^2$:

$$
h^2_i = (\theta + e_i)^2
$$

and thus,

$$
h^2_i = \theta^2 + 2\theta e_i + e_i^2
$$

Now let us further assume that the population parameter is zero ($\theta=0$). Then we will see that the equation above will reduce $h_i^2$ to being equal to the $e_i^2$:

$$
\text{When }\theta=0:\;\;\; h^2_i = e_i^2
$$

The problem now is that the squared sampling error *must* be positive and therefore the expectation of sampling error $e_i^2$ *and* thus the sample estimate $h_i^2$ will *not* be zero. Also, the variance in sampling error (i.e., $\text{Var}(e_i)$) will be larger with smaller sample sizes thus the expectation of $e^2_i$ will be larger as well.

## Simulated Example

Lets assume that in the population, the squared correlation between predicted and observed outcome ($R^2$) is zero, that is, the independent variables ($X_1$,$X_2$, and $X_3$) do not explain any variance in the dependent variable ($Y$). Lets simulate two studies, where one study has a sample size of 100 and the other has a sample size of 25. Then lets replicate these studies 5,000 times. In the first figure we will see that the mean value of $R^2$ is not zero even though the population value is. And with the smaller sample sizes within each study ($N = 25$), the mean $R^2$ is larger.

library(ggplot2)
library(ggdist)
library(ThemePark)
library(patchwork)
library(latex2exp)
set.seed(343)

# sample size
N <- 100

R21 <- R22 <- R23 <- c()
for(i in 1:5000){
  # Obtain simulated scores
  x1 <- rnorm(N,0,1)
  x2 <- rnorm(N,0,1)
  x3 <- rnorm(N,0,1)
  y <- rnorm(N,0,1)
  
  # linear regression model
  mdl <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2 + x3)
  R21[i] <- summary(mdl)$r.squared

  # linear regression model
  mdl <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2 + x3,subset = sample(1:N,25))
  R22[i] <- summary(mdl)$r.squared
}


h1 <- ggplot(data=NULL, aes(R21)) + 
  theme_barbie(barbie_font = FALSE) +
  stat_slabinterval(color = barbie_theme_colors['dark'], 
                    fill = barbie_theme_colors['light']) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,.5)) +
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1, 
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = '#f1f9fa',color = '#f1f9fa'),
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = '#f1f9fa',color = '#f1f9fa'),
        )+
  labs(y = "",x=TeX("$R^2$"), 
       subtitle =  TeX(paste0('N=', 100, ', Ave $R^2$=', round(mean(R21),2))))

h2 <- ggplot(data=NULL, aes(R22)) + 
  theme_barbie(barbie_font = FALSE) +
  stat_slabinterval(color = barbie_theme_colors['dark'], 
                    fill = barbie_theme_colors['light']) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,.5)) +
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1, 
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = '#f1f9fa',color = '#f1f9fa'),
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = '#f1f9fa',color = '#f1f9fa'),
        )+
  labs(y = "",x=TeX("$R^2$"), 
       subtitle = TeX(paste0('N=', 25, ', Ave $R^2$=', round(mean(R22),2))))
  
h1 + h2 & plot_annotation(theme = theme(plot.background = element_rect(color="#f1f9fa",fill ="#f1f9fa")))

```


If we were to run a meta-analysis on all 5,000 studies and found a meta-analytic average $R^2$ of .13, we may conclude that there is a meaningful prediction/effect, however, this could simply be an artifact of sampling error. The plot below shows how the mean R^2 changes as you vary the sample size.

```{r,collapse=TRUE, dev.args=list(bg="transparent"),warning=FALSE}
set.seed(343)

# sample size
N <- 100

R2 <- N <- c()
for(i in 1:5000){
  N[i] <- runif(1,10,70)
  # Obtain simulated scores
  x1 <- rnorm(N[i] ,0,1)
  x2 <- rnorm(N[i] ,0,1)
  x3 <- rnorm(N[i] ,0,1)
  y <- rnorm(N[i] ,0,1)
  # linear regression model
  mdl <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2 + x3)
  R2[i] <- summary(mdl)$r.squared
}


ggplot(data=NULL, aes(N,R2)) + 
  theme_barbie(barbie_font = FALSE) +
  stat_smooth( color = barbie_theme_colors['dark']) + 
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1, 
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = '#f1f9fa',color = '#f1f9fa'),
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = '#f1f9fa',color = '#f1f9fa'),
        )+
  labs(y = TeX("Mean $R^2$"),x="Sample Size", title = "")+ 
  expand_limits(y = 0)


```

## Conclusion

In a meta-analysis, it is always best to use directional effect sizes that can be both positive and negative such as Cohen's $d$'s or Pearson correlations. There are other strategies for meta-analyzing $R^2$ values such as using individual person data meta-analysis (using the raw data for each study) or meta-analyzing the correlation matrix between predictors and outcomes first and then running the regression model on the meta-analytic correlation matrix (this would not allow for non-linear terms though).
