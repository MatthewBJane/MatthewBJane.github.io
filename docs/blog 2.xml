<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="establishing-my-motivation">Establishing my motivation</h2>
<p>Although my original post made it seem that I have some prior opinion that social media effects mental health. In reality, I actually think that social media probably <strong><em>does</em></strong> have an average negative effect on mental health. I also probably agree that the RCTs in this meta-analysis probably won’t find any convincing causal estimates. If Rausch and Haidt’s (R&amp;H) made the argument that there is a causal effect, but the RCTs won’t capture then I would have never made my original post. What I know is meta-analysis, not the literature on social media use and mental health. I was motivated to write the original post because of the clear statistical malpractice employed in R&amp;H’s re-analysis. I have no desire to prove or disprove whether social media is actually detrimental to mental health, but I do have a desire to combat the spread of misleading analyses and poor statistical practice.</p>
<p>Also, to those absurd comments out there that imply that I am somehow working for big Pharma, social media companies, the government, or profiting on some misinformation campaign: I am literally a graduate student who lives with my parents to save money on rent (you can help me out by buying me a <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/matthewbjane">coffee</a>). I do this because I truly believe in the fight for a rigorous, open, and transparent science. I have been very critical of how academia operates and I hope to make some positive change to that end. Anyways, on to the post…</p>

<section id="where-could-i-have-been-better" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="where-could-i-have-been-better">Where could I have been better?</h2>
<p>The best criticisms of my blog outside of R&amp;H’s criticisms seemed to have been that length weeks should have been log scaled (pulling in that 10 week intervention) and also I should have fit some non-linear model. I think these are completely valid points and I will conduct that analysis in this blog post.</p>
<p>R&amp;H responded to one of my last analyses in the post (regressing the effect size on length of intervention) and said the following:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>a blog post by Matthew Jané used Ferguson’s numbers and concluded that there is no relationship between the duration of reduction and the effect size.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is all true (with the slight quibble that I said “little/no” relationship) and I should have been clearer about the assumptions underlying my claim. In my original post I said this:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Okay so as it turns out there appears to be little/no effect of the length of the intervention on the effect size.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I really should have said this:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><span style="color:red;"><strong><em>Given the proposed model and the data,</em></strong></span> there appears to be little/no effect of the length of the intervention on the effect size.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Usually that does not need to be said considering the model was defined, but it is important nonetheless, since if I were to choose a different model it is possible we could have see a relationship between the two variables.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="in-response-to-the-community-note-on-haidts-tweet">In Response to the Community Note on Haidt’s Tweet</h2>
<p>A community note (that I did not write) was attached to Haidt’s tweet containing the R&amp;H re-analysis. It has since disappeared, but here was the content of the note:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>As many statistics experts have pointed out, this analysis is incorrect. If done correctly, the analysis shows that reducing social media has no effect. <em>*then it links to my blog post as a source* </em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although the first sentence I believe is accurate, the <strong>second sentence is not true and I did not state that in the original post</strong>. Therefore I am okay that the community note was taken down for whatever reason. Then promptly, a better and even more recent community note was posted that read,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The reanalysis doesn’t use an appropriate statistical model. It simply calculates an unweighted average across different studies, doesn’t provide confidence intervals, and misinterprets the evidence</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All these points are unequivocally true. However, Haidt then posted the following tweet,</p>
<p></p><div id="tweet-39977"></div><script>tweet={"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JonHaidt\/status\/1830583665891385415","author_name":"Jonathan Haidt","author_url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JonHaidt","html":"\u003Cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" align=\"center\"\u003E\u003Cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003EI&#39;m glad to see the community note has been toned down.

<p>This tweet seemed to get his followers to rate the community note as unhelpful and thus it was taken down again. Of course, it is difficult to maintain a community note with Haidt’s large following. So I guess we will have to treat these blog posts as a much more detailed community note.</p>
<p>I think this community note was not only fair but absolutely true is much more fair and captures the overall criticism I was making. After Haid</p>

<section id="rhs-analysis-was-unequivocally-a-meta-analysis" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rhs-analysis-was-unequivocally-a-meta-analysis">R&amp;H’s analysis was unequivocally a meta-analysis</h2>
<p>In a tweet by Haidt, he pointed out that R&amp;H’s re-analysis should not be considered a meta-analysis:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I think it was a mistake to treat our essay as a meta-analysis</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason I treated R&amp;H’s re-analysis as a meta-analysis is because it is, by definition, a meta-analysis. Let me be clear, R&amp;H’s analysis consisted of <strong>1) averaging results across studies</strong> and <strong>2) counting up positive, negative, and null effects</strong>, both of which are just different obsolete and unacceptable methods of meta-analysis (the latter is commonly referred to as a vote-counting meta-analysis). If you are unconvinced, here is the definition of a meta-analysis from the <a href="https://training.cochrane.org/handbook/current/chapter-10">Cochrane handbook</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Meta-analysis is the statistical combination of results from two or more separate studies.</p>
</blockquote>

<section id="errors-in-effect-sizes-and-sample-sizes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="errors-in-effect-sizes-and-sample-sizes">Errors in Effect Sizes and Sample Sizes</h2>
<p>Haidt also claims that there are errors in the effect sizes and sample sizes in <span class="citation" data-cites="ferguson2024">Ferguson (2024)</span>’s meta-analysis:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Our post was about how there are so many errors in the Ferguson meta, including errors in sample sizes and effect sizes, that we can’t yet do weighting or confidence intervals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet R&amp;H still conduct their re-analysis on those effect sizes. <strong>If the data is untrustworthy why conduct the any analysis in the first place?</strong> Why is it more justifiable to compute unweighted average effects without any indicator of variability from that data base? If the data is untrustworthy, why conduct the analysis at all? If we decide to conduct an analysis, we must do it using the appropriate statistical techniques. <strong>Like I said previously, if R&amp;H retracted their re-analysis and instead argued that these RCTs do not properly capture the causal effects of social media on mental health, I would possibly even agree with them.</strong></p>
<p>I do not have the time to double check all the effect sizes of Ferguson’s meta-analysis. I analyzed them at face value which is exactly what R&amp;H did in their re-analyses.</p>
</section>
<section id="haidts-future-meta-analysis" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="haidts-future-meta-analysis">Haidt’s future meta-analysis</h2>
<p>Haidt has proposed that he is planning to conduct a re-do of the <span class="citation" data-cites="ferguson2024">Ferguson (2024)</span>’s meta-analysis</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Nonetheless, all of this is to show why we are not trying to do our own meta analysis with Ferguson’s data. In a future post we plan to do a review of the evidence from scratch so that we avoid these many problems. (It’s worth noting that we have also found five additional multi-week reduction studies, all of which find benefits to reduction, which are not in Ferguson’s meta).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><em>To Jonathan Haidt</em></strong>: <strong>I would love to offer my help as a collaborator/consultant for this upcoming project so that we can establish a systematic, transparent, reproducible, and rigorous review, and meta-analysis plan. I also know many awesome and knowledgeable meta-analysts that I would be happy to recommend to you. You can email me at matthew.jane@uconn.edu</strong></p>
<p>Constructing a solid meta-analysis is not only difficult, it is also exceedingly rare. Like any other field of study, there are experts.</p>

<section id="controversy-surrounding-the-study-by-collis-and-egger-2022" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="controversy-surrounding-the-study-by-collis-and-egger-2022">Controversy surrounding the study by Collis and Egger (2022)</h2>
<p>R&amp;H’s primary critique of my analysis was that Collis and Egger’s (2022) study shouldn’t be included because the manipulation check failed. From my reading of the paper, the treatment group did demonstrate lower screen time for facebook, instagram, and snapchat, however <em>higher</em> for instant messaging apps, news/media, gaming, as well as overall screen time. R&amp;H mention WhatsApp as one of the primary apps that people replaced social media with. It does not seem that people really consider instant messaging like WhatsApp a form of social media (see poll results below):</p>
<p></p><div id="tweet-25682"></div><script>tweet={"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MatthewBJane\/status\/1830399884299481182","author_name":"Matthew B Jané","author_url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MatthewBJane","html":"\u003Cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" align=\"center\"\u003E\u003Cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003EWould you consider WhatsApp and other instant messaging Apps as “Social Media”?\u003C\/p\u003E&mdash; Matthew B Jané (@MatthewBJane) \u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MatthewBJane\/status\/1830399884299481182?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003ESeptember 2, 2024\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cscript async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"\u003E\u003C\/script\u003E\n\n","width":550,"height":null,"type":"rich","cache_age":"3153600000","provider_name":"Twitter","provider_url":"https:\/\/twitter.com","version":"1.0"};document.getElementById("tweet-25682").innerHTML = tweet["html"];</script><p></p>
<p>It does not seem clear to me that this is a failed manipulation check, especially considering total digital screen time is not the target intervention variable. R&amp;H also mention there is no evidence that other social media apps were used:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In addition, there is no evidence that participants reduced their use of other social media platforms such as TikTok, YouTube, Twitter, and Reddit (all of which were widely used by college students in 2019).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However that is true for a lot of the other studies in this meta-analysis where screen time wasn’t even monitored or monitored with self-report rather than more objective measures. I do not think we should punish one study for being transparent and providing a manipulation check.</p>
<p>Although I am against the exclusion of Collis and Eggers (2022) in principle, I will nevertheless fit the regression model with and without it.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="garden-of-forking-paths">Garden of Forking paths</h2>
<p>It appears to me, the exclusion of Collis and Eggers (2022) was decided on through an unsystematic process. The exclusion of this study coupled with the post-hoc bins of studies that R&amp;H constructed, unweighted averaging, lack of confidence intervals or indicators of variability, . They do not provide a clear and consistent inclusion criterion applied to all studies. R&amp;H seem to overly focus on the study which so happens to be the most problematic for their desired results. This could be an inappropriate take, however this is how it is appearing to my eyes.</p>

<p>In my blog post, I regressed the effect size on length of the intervention using a linear meta-regression which estimates the conditional mean effect size with a straight line. I have had a number of people request that weeks should be logged (which will pull in that Collis and Egger study) and fit a non-linear basis spline to the effects. I totally agree with this approach. Essentially we are modeling the conditional mean of the effect size as a non-linear function of the length of weeks. This will help account for the withdrawal effect that R&amp;H had mentioned.</p>
<p>Let’s first fit the model with the Collis and Egger (2022) included in the data:</p>

<p>As we kind of would have expected, you see an initial increase in the conditional mean and then a slow fall over time. Still there is a lot of variability both in the true effects (prediction interval) and in the conditional mean effect (confidence interval) so it is difficult to say anything with confidence.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, even without Collis and Egger’s study there really isn’t a whole lot we can say here with confidence. It does not really even appear that the trend is any stronger and it still looks like it may even fade to zero.

<p>Ultimately, after re-running the model with a more sophisticated non-linear regression with and without the Collis &amp; Egger study that Haidt suggested, there is still no good evidence of detrimental effects in these RCTs. This does not mean social media is not, on average, detrimental for mental health, it just means that these these RCTs do not appear be good evidence of that fact.</p>

<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The article by Rausch and Haidt (R&amp;H) conducts a re-analysis of a meta-analysis by <span class="citation" data-cites="ferguson2024">Ferguson (2024)</span> on RCTs assessing the causal effect (for the sake of this post, I am avoiding any causal inference issues) of social media usage on outcomes related to well-being (e.g., life satisfaction, anxiety). However, the re-analysis conducted by R&amp;H has severe flaws. Generally speaking, if you conduct a re-analysis of any study you should be certain that the re-analysis is of higher methodological quality than the original study. That is not the case here. This blog will get a bit technical, but it is important because meta-analysis isn’t just crunching numbers across studies. There is a formal statistical model that we should adhere to to actually produce coherent and interpretable results.</p>
<p>The original meta-analysis by <span class="citation" data-cites="ferguson2024">Ferguson (2024)</span> is not without a number of flaws, but I think it accomplished what it set out to do. Notably, the meta-analysis was pre-registered, transparent, and had publicly available data. The only problem with the open data is that the statistics used to calculate the effect sizes (reported t-statistics, means, SDs, etc.) are completely missing from the database which makes reproducing it a lot harder.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="ferguson2024">Ferguson (2024)</span>’s meta-analysis has a couple things that stood out to me as I was skimmed through it. It seems that all measures related to mental health and well-being are combined even if they are conceptually quite different (e.g., self-esteem and anxiety). When a study reported multiple different outcome measures, Ferguson decided to pool them together presumably to handle the dependency in effects. This is not an ideal strategy for two reasons, it assumes there is no heterogeneity between outcomes and it also loses specificity in the outcome. It would have been nice to see narrower bins of constructs meta-analyzed separately such as clinical anxiety/depression measures or life satisfaction/subjective well-being measures.</p>
<p>Also, the results convey a common misinterpretation of the estimate in a random effects meta-analysis. The meta-analytic estimate was communicated as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>As can be seen the overall estimate for d across studies was 0.088, which was nonsignificant and well below the SESOI (r = .10, d = 0.21).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What does an “overall estimate for <em>d</em>” actually mean (note: <em>d</em> is the effect size, we will talk about this in the next section)? Is there a true <em>d</em> that we are estimating by averaging the <em>d</em> values from all these studies together? No.&nbsp;A random-effects meta-analysis is estimating the <strong>mean of true effect sizes</strong>. That is, there exists a distribution of true effects and the meta-analytic estimate conveys the central tendency. Therefore, the meta-analytic estimate can <em>not</em> tell you whether the the intervention produces an effect of <em>d</em> = .088 (lets ignore the variability in this estimate for the moment), it only tells you that the effect is <em>d</em> = .088, <strong><em>on average</em></strong>. Heterogeneity in effect sizes describes how wide the distribution of true effects is. You <em>could</em> have genuine true effects that are very positive (i.e., social media use is detrimental) and very negative (i.e., social media use is beneficial) even if the meta-analytic estimate is zero. There also could be study-level characteristics that could account for this heterogeneity, for instance, studies using a particular type of experimental design or a certain outcome shows a positive effect while others don’t.</p>
<p><strong>A side note</strong>: I also came across this sentence from <span class="citation" data-cites="ferguson2024">Ferguson (2024)</span>’s meta-analysis on page 3:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Given the high power of meta-analysis, almost all meta-analyses are “statistically significant.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have heard this before but it is just not true, in general. In a random effects meta-analysis where you have both within and between study variance can give pretty wide confidence intervals and large p-values. This would be a reasonable statement if you are referring to a fixed effect meta-analysis with a large total sample size or a random effect meta-analysis with a ton of studies. Neither of which are true in this case.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lets-get-into-it">Let’s get into it</h2>
<p>The first part of this blog sets up a statistical meta-analysis model called a random-effects model. It is important to keep in mind that a meta-analysis is not throwing a bunch of standardized effects into a calculator and computing a mean. We need a coherent statistical model that allows us to draw meaningful inferences from the data.</p>

<p>First thing we should do is to define the effect size we are using to quantify the effect of social media on well-being related outcomes. The article by <span class="citation" data-cites="ferguson2024">Ferguson (2024)</span> says they used a standardized mean difference known as a Cohen’s <em>d</em> to quantify the difference between the post-test scores in the social media using group and the non-social media using group (or some variation of that). You may think “we should be controlling for baseline differences between treatment and control groups”, well in an RCT subject’s are randomly allocated to each group so their baseline scores should be, on average, the same. We can define a (true) effect size <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdelta"> as,</p>
<p><span id="eq-effect"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cdelta%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cmu_%5Ctextrm%7Bsocial%7D%20-%20%5Cmu_%5Ctextrm%7Bno%20social%7D%7D%7B%5Csigma%7D%0A%5Ctag%7B1%7D"></span></p>
<p>where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu_%5Ctextrm%7Bsocial%7D"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu_%5Ctextrm%7Bno%20social%7D"> is the mean of post-test scores for the social media using group and the non-social media using group (i.e., control group), respectively. The standardizer <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma"> is the within-group standard deviation and it assumes that both the social media and non-social media group have the same standard deviation (probably a fine assumption 🤷). A sample estimator of the effect size will be denoted as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d"> and it represents the effect size we actually observe from the results of a study,</p>
<p><span id="eq-sample-effect"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ad%20=%20%5Cfrac%7Bm_%5Ctextrm%7Bsocial%7D%20-%20m_%5Ctextrm%7Bno%20social%7D%7D%7Bs_%5Cmathrm%7Bpooled%7D%7D,%0A%5Ctag%7B2%7D"></span></p>
<p>where English letters denote the sample estimators of the corresponding parameters in Equation&nbsp;1. The standardizer <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s_%5Cmathrm%7Bpooled%7D"> here is the pooled standard deviation. Since we only have access to the standard deviation of each group we have to pool them together to get a more precise estimate of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma"> (again, we are assuming the standard deviations within both groups are equal in the population),</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0As_%5Cmathrm%7Bpooled%7D%20=%20%5Csqrt%7B%5Cfrac%7B(n_%5Ctextrm%7Bsocial%7D-1)s%5E2_%5Ctextrm%7Bsocial%7D%20+%20(n_%5Ctextrm%7Bno%20social%7D-1)s%5E2_%5Ctextrm%7Bno%20social%7D%7D%7Bn_%5Ctextrm%7Bsocial%7D%20+%20n_%5Ctextrm%7Bno%20social%7D%20-%202%7D%7D%0A"></p>
<p>I will note here, that there was no correction for small sample bias in the original meta-analysis as far as I could tell so I will not apply any correction here.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="statistical-model">Statistical Model</h2>
<p>Ultimately, the observed effect size <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d"> is a sample estimate of the true effect size <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdelta"> and therefore will contain error. This error is referred to as <strong>sampling error</strong> and is defined as the difference between the observed effect size and the true effect size. For a given study <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i">, we can relate the observed effect size <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d_i"> and the true effect size <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdelta_i"> by including a sampling error term (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvarepsilon_i">),</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ad_i%20=%20%5Cdelta_i%20+%20%5Cvarepsilon_i%0A"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvarepsilon_i"> is literally defined as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvarepsilon_i%20=%20d_i%20-%20%5Cdelta_i">. The extent to which sampling errors are obscuring our effect size can be captured by the <strong>sampling variance</strong>. We can assume that sampling errors are normally distributed and evenly distributed around zero such that, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvarepsilon_i%20%5Csim%20%5Cmathcal%7BN%7D(0,v_i)"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v_i"> is the sampling variance for study <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i">. The sampling variance for a given study is dependent on the sample size with larger samples having more precision and thus less variance. Assuming normally distributed data, the sampling variance of the standardized mean difference (Equation&nbsp;2) is calculated with the following formula,</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Av%20=%20%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7Bn-1%7D%7Bn-3%7D%5Cright)%20%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7Bn%7D%7Bn_%5Ctextrm%7Bsocial%7Dn_%5Ctextrm%7Bno%20social%7D%7D%5Cright)%5Cleft(%20%5Cfrac%7Bd%5E2%7D%7B2n%7D%5Cright)%0A"></p>
<p>where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n=n_%5Ctextrm%7Bsocial%7D+n_%5Ctextrm%7Bno%20social%7D">. However unfortunately, the available dataset from <span class="citation" data-cites="ferguson2024">Ferguson (2024)</span> did not provide the sample sizes within each group so instead we will have to assume they are equal (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n_%5Ctextrm%7Bsocial%7D=n_%5Ctextrm%7Bno%20social%7D">) and use the simplified formula,</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Av%20=%20%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7Bn-1%7D%7Bn-3%7D%5Cright)%20%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7B4%7D%7Bn%7D%5Cright)%5Cleft(1%20+%20%5Cfrac%7Bd%5E2%7D%7B8%7D%5Cright)%0A"></p>
<p>Now we might expect that any variation in effect sizes across studies is attributable to variance in random sampling errors, however this is unlikely to be the case. In reality, effect sizes tend to vary across studies above and beyond what we would expect from sampling error alone. This extra variation (known as heterogeneity) in effect sizes could be due to sampling from different populations, utilizing different methodologies, using different measures, etc.</p>
<p>Recall that we modeled an observed effect size as the sum of the true effect size for that study and sampling error <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d_i%20=%20%5Cdelta_i%20+%20%5Cvarepsilon_i">. We defined the distribution of sampling errors so now we can also define the distribution of true effect sizes as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdelta_i%20%5Csim%20%5Cmathcal%7BN%7D(%5Cmu_%5Cdelta,%5Ctau%5E2)"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu_%5Cdelta"> is the mean of true effect sizes across studies and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau%5E2"> is the variance of true effect sizes (i.e., heterogeneity). Ultimately our goal in a meta-analysis is to estimate both <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu_%5Cdelta"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau">. The common misinterpretation in (random-effect) meta-analyses that I described in the introduction is that a meta-analysis is estimating a single true effect size. If there is heterogeneity (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau%5E2%20%3E%200">) then there is a distribution of true effects that we must consider.</p>
</section>
<section id="parameter-estimation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="parameter-estimation">Parameter estimation</h2>
<p>In meta-analysis we are trying to estimate particular parameters (i.e., the mean <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu_%5Cdelta"> and variance <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau"> of true effect sizes) just like any other statistical model. Simply averaging study effect sizes to obtain some “overall” effect size is not a principled statistical approach. This is why we went through the trouble of describing a random effects model in the previous section. We want to estimate the <em>mean</em> of true effect sizes (<strong>not</strong> the “overall effect size” or “the true effect size”). To estimate the mean of true effects <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu_%5Cdelta"> we can not just calculate the arithmetic mean of observed effect sizes. Instead we must use appropriate weights that take advantage of differential precision across studies. Particularly, we want to weight each study by the inverse variance,</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Aw_i%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Ctau%5E2%20+%20v_i%7D%0A"> This will preferentially weight studies with less sampling variance (i.e., larger sample sizes). Also, since <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau%5E2"> is the same for all studies, the larger <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau%5E2"> is relative to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v_i"> then the weights will become more equal across studies. We can then use these weights to estimate the mean true effect size by taking a weighted average of observed effect sizes across <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k"> studies,</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Chat%7B%5Cmu%7D_%5Cdelta%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Csum%5Ek_%7Bi=1%7D%20w_i%20d_i%7D%7B%5Csum%5Ek_%7Bi=1%7D%20w_i%7D%0A"> where the little carrot <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Chat%7B%5Ccdot%7D"> denotes an estimate. We can also compute the 95% confidence interval of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Chat%7B%5Cmu%7D_%5Cdelta"> (the set of plausible values of the actual mean that are compatible with the data) using the Hartung, Knapp, Sidik and Jonkman method (this adjusts for poor coverage rates in small <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k"> meta-analyses, which is the case here),</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0ACI%20=%20%20%5Chat%7B%5Cmu%7D_%5Cdelta%20%5Cpm%201.96%20%5Ccdot%5Csqrt%7B%5Cfrac%7B%5Csum%5Ek_%7Bi=1%7Dw_i(d_i-%5Cmu_%5Cdelta)%5E2%7D%7B(k-1)%5Csum%5Ek_%7Bi=1%7Dw_i%7D%7D%0A"></p>
<p>The last two things we want to estimate are the variance in true effects <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau%5E2"> and what is known as a prediction interval. The variance in true effects is estimated a variety of different ways and we won’t go through all of them here. Instead we will exclusively use a restricted maximum likelihood estimator (REML) which is an iterative estimation procedure. <span class="citation" data-cites="ferguson2024">Ferguson (2024)</span> uses a maximum likelihood estimator (ML), however ML tends to under-estimate the heterogeneity. The 95% prediction interval uses the information from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Chat%7B%5Ctau%7D"> to construct an interval that can be interpreted as the interval where 95% of true effect sizes fall.</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0API%20=%20%5Chat%7B%5Cmu%7D_%5Cdelta%20%5Cpm%201.96%20%5Ccdot%5Chat%5Ctau%0A"></p>
<p>So just keep in mind that the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?CI"> describes the variability in the estimate of the mean and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?PI"> describes the variability in the true effects.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rhs-analysis">R&amp;H’s analysis</h2>
<p>R&amp;H conduct a sub-group analysis by chopping up the studies into three bins. First issue here is that this analysis is completely post-hoc and who knows if they created these bins after trying various combinations to reach the conclusion that they desired. R&amp;H separate the 27 studies into three bins (this is verbatim from the article):</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Multi-week reduction experiments.</strong> These ten studies examined the impact of reducing social media use for at least two weeks, allowing withdrawal symptoms to dissipate.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Short (one week or less) reduction experiments.</strong> These ten studies examined brief periods of abstinence from social media use, which are likely to pick up withdrawal symptoms from heavy users.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Exposure experiments.</strong> In these seven studies, the ‘treatment’ is typically brief exposure to some kind of social media, such as requiring high school students to look at their Facebook or Instagram page for 10 minutes.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The second problem we see is that the first two groups are separated by dichotomizing a naturally continuous variable (length of intervention). Sure it makes the data more digestible, but you simply lose information. This is generally considered bad statistical practice and we will see why a little later.</p>
<p>To reproduce R&amp;H’s analysis, we will add a column to the data set that denotes the group membership (1 = Multi-week reduction experiments, 2 = One week reduction experiments, 3 = Less than one week reduction experiments, 4 = Exposure experiments) of each study.</p>

<p>Now that we have the subgroup column, we can conduct the sub-group analysis. Here comes the next problem, R&amp;H decide to simply calculates the arithmetic (unweighted) mean of the observed effect sizes within each group. The problem is that they aren’t capitalizing on the fact that different studies have different levels of precision. The only way it would make sense to compute an unweighted average with respect to the statistical model we are employing is if sampling error didn’t exist (it does) or heterogeneity is infinite (its not), so either way its just the wrong approach.</p>
<p>Let’s first reproduce R&amp;H’s results by taking the unweighted average of observed effect sizes.</p>

<p>Okay we see a positive average effect for the multi-week reduction experiments, but lets now use proper inverse-variance weights to calculate the average. This time we will model the groups as dummy predictors and specify the proper contrasts for each group:</p>

<p>As we can see the estimates are a bit different. Another thing that is completely missing from the R&amp;H analysis is any indication of variability in their mean estimates and their is no indication of heterogeneity. It is conveyed as a fixed quantity, however just because we combine many studies together does not mean that uncertainty ceases to exist.</p>

<p>True effects for group 1 (multi-week reduction studies, i.e., the focal group) are quite variable and can range from -0.296 to 0.651. An interesting point to bring up is that <span class="citation" data-cites="ferguson2024">Ferguson (2024)</span> set the smallest effect size of interest (SESOI) to be <em>d</em> = .21 in his pre-registration (equivalent to a Pearson correlation of <em>r</em> = .10). However, that does not help us much here since the upper bound of the confidence interval is well above <em>d</em> = .21 so you can’t really make the claim that that there is no clinically meaningful effect, <em>on average</em>. And you definitely can’t make the claim that all/most true effects are not clinically meaningful since the upper bound of the PI is 0.651. Truthfully, the SESOI established in <span class="citation" data-cites="ferguson2024">Ferguson (2024)</span> does not seem to have any good theoretical or practical justification outside of “seems reasonable” so it is unclear what the utility of this arbitrary boundary is in this case?</p>

<p>Okay so as it turns out there appears to be little/no effect of the length of the intervention on the effect size. Let us plot out the data to see what the relationship actually looks like:</p>

<p>The regression line looks almost parallel to the <em>d</em> = 0 line (the grey line). You may notice the outlier at 10 weeks and you may want to remove it from the analysis. I would ask why? The data point does not appear to be a coding error or a mistake? It is a valid data point and piece of evidence that should not be taken out of the analysis post-hoc. Hell, it could be that the the positive effect of not being on social media only lasts a few weeks and then fades out (not an uncommon trend in psychology interventions). Anyways, any reason to remove that “outlier” would seem to me like a post-hoc rationalization.</p>

<p>The re-analysis of <span class="citation" data-cites="ferguson2024">Ferguson (2024)</span>’s meta-analysis by R&amp;H does not have adequate statistical rigor to build a “case for causality”. Post-hoc subgroup analyses conducted by R&amp;H did not use a principled statistical model, they did not report any variability in their estimates, the estimates themselves were sub-optimal (unweighted averaging), and they misinterpreted the point-estimates that they calculated. They did not do a proper comparison of their point-estimates and instead they treated them as fixed quantities and simply claimed that these average effect sizes are different without consideration of variability in their estimation procedure. Their conclusion claimed that:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>we still found that his data <em>supports</em> (rather than undermines) the contention by some scholars that “reductions in social media time would improve adolescent mental health,” at least as long as the reductions continue for two weeks or longer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Based on my re-analysis of R&amp;H’s re-analysis I find that the intervention length when modeled properly as a continuous variable (since it literally is) does not support this claim.</p>
<p>If I did anything incorrectly or if I did not use best practices, I take full responsibility and you can let me know by sending me a DM on twitter or emailing me at matthewbjane@gmail.com.</p>

<section id="some-useful-definitions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="some-useful-definitions">Some useful definitions</h2>
<p>Let us first note that when I refer to a <strong>measurand</strong> I simply mean the (psychological) attribute that we intend to measure.</p>
<p>A <strong>realist</strong> defines the measurand outside of the measurement procedure, that is, the measurand is some test-independent attribute that is estimated by scores produced by the test.</p>
<p>An <strong>operationalist</strong> would instead suppose that the measurand is defined by the test itself and can not be defined outside of the test (i.e., the measurand is test-dependent). Note that a <em>strict</em> operationalist in the form that I discuss in this blog post is a sort of extreme operationalist. In the measurement error modeling section, I also describe a <em>laxed operationalist</em>, but it is just a useful descriptor for contrasting two types of operationalist measurement models.</p>
<p>A <strong>respectful operationalist</strong> is an operationalist that defines the measurand in terms of the test, but the test is validated for extra-operational meanings and usability <span class="citation" data-cites="vessonen2021">(i.e., meanings and usability beyond the test, Vessonen 2021)</span>. So the respectful operationalist is kind of like “sure, yeah we can define the measurand in terms of the test, but the test needs to incorporate common connotations of the target concept and produce usable scores”.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-might-validity-look-like-in-each-of-these-frameworks" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-might-validity-look-like-in-each-of-these-frameworks">What might validity look like in each of these frameworks</h2>
<p>In <strong>realist</strong> framework, validity may fall under the principles set by <span class="citation" data-cites="borsboom2004">Borsboom, Mellenbergh, and Van Heerden (2004)</span>, where the psychological attribute (or construct) has to both 1) exist and 2) cause variation in the measurement procedure. This view of validity is centered around construct validity.</p>
<p>A (strict) <strong>operationalist</strong> need not validate a measure, even if the measure is nonsensical, the measurand is still defined by the test.</p>
<p>A <strong>respectful operationalist</strong> can validate a measure using a similar approach to Michael T. Kane’s argument-based approach to validity in which he guides researchers to specify and justify the intended use of the measure. Specifically, <span class="citation" data-cites="vessonen2021">Vessonen (2021)</span> proposes that a test is valid if the test incorporates common extra-operational connotations of the target concept. This will be more closely related to test-related types of validity such as content and criterion validity.</p>
</section>
<section id="operationalist-and-realist-measurement-error-models" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="operationalist-and-realist-measurement-error-models">Operationalist and Realist Measurement Error Models</h2>
<p>Okay let’s start at the foundation: we observe a test score <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X_p"> for a person, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p">.</p>
<p><strong>A strict operationalist</strong> may simply define a person’s <em>true</em> score <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T_p"> as the observed score such that, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T_p%20=%20X_p">. Trivially, the observed score can be modeled <em>as</em> the true score,</p>
<p><span id="eq-1"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AX_p%20=%20T_p%0A%5Ctag%7B1%7D"></span></p>
<p>There is something attractive and so practical about this model, however there are immediate problems of usability. What if we test that person again and they obtain a different score? What if the scoring is done by a rater and a different rater assigns a different score to that person? To answer this, let us use an example where a person’s true score is defined as the observed score <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X_%7Bpar%7D">, for person <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p">, test administration <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a">, and rater <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r"> such that,</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AT_p%20=%20X_%7Bpar%7D%0A"></p>
<p>However the problem now is that if the observed score varies across test-administrations and/or raters then the true score will not be generalizable across test-administrations or raters,</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AT_p%20=%20X_%7Bpar%7D%20%5Cneq%20X_%7Bpa(r+1)%7D%20%5Cneq%20X_%7Bp(a+1)r%7D%0A"></p>
<p>This will force us to define a true score for not only each person, but <em>also</em> each test administration and rater such that,</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AT_%7Bpar%7D%20=%20X_%7Bpar%7D.%0A"></p>
<p>However differences in observed scores between test-administration and raters may not be of scientific interest if we only really care about person-level differences. This specific operationalist approach is simply unusable in practice. Although, it is interesting to note, that the reliability of observed scores is necessarily perfect and can be shown by the reliability index, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Crho_%7BXT%7D=1"> (i.e., the correlation between true and observed scores).</p>
<p>A more <strong>laxed operationalist</strong> definition of true scores would be to define it based on the <em>expectation</em> of observed scores conditional on a person. Therefore a definition of a true score for a given person can be expressed by,</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AT_p%20=%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5BX_%7Bpar%7D%5Cmid%20p%5D%0A"></p>
<p>Conditional expectation (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5B%5Ccdot%5D">) is the average observed score over all possible observed scores for a given person. This also provides the beautiful property that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X_%7Bp%7D"> for a given person, is <em>calibrated</em> to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T_p">, since,</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AT_p%20-%20%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5BX_p%5Cmid%20p%5D%20=%20T_p%20-%20T_p%20=%20%200.%0A"></p>
<p>So now, even if observed scores vary across raters and/or test administrations, the true score will remain constant. The question at this point is how can we model a single instance of an observed score. Here, we will need to introduce measurement errors. <strong>Measurement errors</strong> can be defined as differences between observed scores and true scores. Remember that in our strict operationalist model (Equation&nbsp;1) we did not have any measurement errors since the true score was equivalent to the observed score (i.e., if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T_p%20=%20X_p">, then <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T_p%20-%20X_p%20=%200">). Now that the true score is the conditional expectation of the observed score, a single instance of an observed score <em>can</em> differ from the true score. We can thus add a new term to the model described in Equation&nbsp;1,</p>
<p><span id="eq-ctt"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AX_%7Bp%7D%20=%20T_p%20+%20E_%7Bp%7D,%0A%5Ctag%7B2%7D"></span></p>
<p>where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?E_%7Bp%7D"> indicates the error in the observed score for a given person and measurement. Since we started with the definition of true scores being <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T_p%20=%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5BX%20%5Cmid%20%20p%5D">, an extremely useful consequence of this is that the conditional expectation of measurement errors within a person is zero. We can demonstrate why this is the case with a short derivation (first re-arranging Equation&nbsp;2 so that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?E_%7Bp%7D"> is on the left hand side),</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbegin%7Balign%7D%0A%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5BE_%7Bp%7D%5Cmid%20p%5D%20&amp;=%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5BT_p%20-%20%20X_p%5Cmid%20p%5D%20%5C%5C%5B.3em%5D%0A&amp;=%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5BT_p%5Cmid%20p%5D%20-%20%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5BX_p%5Cmid%20p%5D%20%5C%5C%5B.3em%5D%0A&amp;=%20T_p%20-%20%20T_p%20%5C%5C%5B.3em%5D%0A&amp;=%200%20%5C%5C%0A%5Cend%7Balign%7D"></p>
<p>Errors that balance out over all possible observed scores for a given person is what distinguishes the classical test theory model from other measurement models <span class="citation" data-cites="kroc2020">(Kroc and Zumbo 2020)</span>. It is important to note that the algebraic formulation of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X=T+E"> is <strong>not</strong> what defines the classical test theory model, in fact, many measurement error models come in an analogous form. It is the conditional expectations between the components of the model which distinguish classical errors from other measurement error models <span class="citation" data-cites="kroc2020">(e.g., Berkson errors, see Kroc and Zumbo 2020)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>A realist</strong> model may suppose that the true score is a construct score that is an objective value that is defined outside of the measurement operations (the actual value of the construct/attribute being measured; <span class="citation" data-cites="borsboom2002">Borsboom and Mellenbergh (2002)</span>). Therefore we can not define true scores in terms of observed scores without knowing how observed scores are calibrated true scores. The realist model for an observed score is superficially identical to Equation&nbsp;2,</p>
<p><span id="eq-nctt"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AX_%7Bp%7D%20=%20T_p%20+%20E_%7Bp%7D,%0A%5Ctag%7B3%7D"></span></p>
<p>with the major difference being that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5BX%7Cp%5D%20%5Cneq%20T_p">. Note that Equation&nbsp;3 is <em>not</em> the classical test theory model because it does not, by default, meet the assumptions of classical test theory that the laxed operationalist model does (Equation&nbsp;2). The big difference between this realist model the laxed operationalist model is that the conditional expectation of errors is no longer zero in the realist approach, and thus systematic errors (i.e., biased estimates of true scores) can exist. In order to recover proper calibration of the observed scores to true scores, we would have to just assume that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5BE_p%5Cmid%20p%5D=0"> (see flaws below).</p>
<p>When it comes to psychological constructs the realist approach has two major flaws to me.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Necessitates the existence of a construct score that is independent of the measure. Without sufficient evidence of a construct existing, we are adding additional complexity to our theory. Therefore it adds increased complexity into our theory.</p></li>
<li><p>Even if the construct is real and has a true construct score, we have no idea how the observed scores are calibrated to those true scores. The operationalist model produces a calibrated measure by definition whereas the realist model needs to add an additional assumption (i.e., conditioned on a given person, the expectation of measurement errors is zero) in order for the observed scores to be calibrated.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The operationalist model may have the biggest flaw so far:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Since the measurand is defined by the measure itself, you can not really draw any meaningful inferences about anything outside of the measure.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is a third option though!</p>
</section>
<section id="respectful-operationalist-measurement-error-model" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="respectful-operationalist-measurement-error-model">Respectful Operationalist Measurement Error Model</h2>
<p>As put by the originator of Respectful Operationalism Elina <span class="citation" data-cites="vessonen2021">Vessonen (2021)</span> states,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[Respectful Operationalism] is the view that we may define a target concept in terms of a test, as long as that test is validated to incorporate common connotations of the target concept and the usability of the measure</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore we need to identify which observed scores are produced by tests that have been validated for extra-operational connotations for the concept of interest. We generally have inter-subjective agreement about the meanings of concepts like intelligence, anxiety, and depression mean outside of the measurement instrument. We can imagine that items contain content that are more or less related to those inter-subjective meanings. The extent to which the item content is relevant to the concept of interest reflects the item’s <strong>content validity</strong>. The true score can be defined as the conditional expectation of observed scores obtained from tests containing items that are sufficiently valid (this could be done from inter-rater assessment of the conceptual relatedness of items and concepts) can define the true scores. that contain sufficient validity. Let’s define an observed score produced by a sufficiently valid test as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X_p%5E%5Cstar">. As an example, a measure of depression that produces observed scores from responses to the question, “what is your age?”, would not encompass common connotations of depression and therefore those observed scores would <em>not</em> in the set of <em>valid</em> observed scores. This new model can be defined as,</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AX%5E%5Cstar_p%20=%20T_p%20+%20E_p%0A"></p>
<p>where</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AT_p%20=%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5BX%5E%5Cstar_p%5Cmid%20p%5D%0A"></p>
<p>In this way, inferences about concepts can be made from observed scores since they hold inherent relevance by virtue of prior validation of the test’s extra-operational meaning.</p>
</section>
<section id="my-current-stance" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="my-current-stance">My current stance</h2>
<p>Respectful operationalism appears to offer the practical advantages of operationalism such as calibrated measurement outcomes, without the limitation of being unable to draw meaningful inferences beyond the test. To consider myself a realist for a particular attribute/construct, then I would have to be sufficiently convinced of the tenants of construct validity described by <span class="citation" data-cites="borsboom2004">Borsboom, Mellenbergh, and Van Heerden (2004)</span>: (1) the attribute exists (2) the construct causes variation in outcomes of the measurement procedure. Currently, I am not sufficiently convinced this is the case this is the case for most (if not all) psychological constructs; therefore, I am not comfortable making the commitments necessary to take on a realist position. Therefore, to me, a know-nothin grad student, Respectful Operationalism seems to best align with my current worldview.</p>

<section id="defining-a-squared-effect-size" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="defining-a-squared-effect-size">Defining a Squared Effect Size</h2>
<p>Sometimes squared effect sizes are used in order to interpret results (e.g., <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R%5E2">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ceta%5E2">). However these squared indices are biased in small sample sizes. To see why this is the case we can describe the mathematically. Generally, lets say we have some observed effect size <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h_i"> for a sample <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i">. This can be modeled as a function of a population correlation <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctheta"> and sampling error <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?e_i">,</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ah_i%20=%20%5Ctheta%20+%20e_i%0A"></p>
<p>Where the expectation of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h_i"> (i.e., the average) upon repeated sampling is equal to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctheta">. More importantly for us, the expectation of sampling error <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?e_i"> across repeated samples would be zero. For the expectation of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?e_i"> to be zero, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?e"> would need to be randomly distributed around zero with both positive and negative values. Let us see what happens to the model once we square both sides to obtain <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h%5E2">:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ah%5E2_i%20=%20(%5Ctheta%20+%20e_i)%5E2%0A"></p>
<p>and thus,</p>

<p>The squared effect sizes is now no longer an unbiased estimate of theta. The bias in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h_i%5E2"> can be seen by taking the expected value of both sides (note that the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctext%7BVar%7D(e_i)"> is the sampling error variance and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5B%5Ccdot%5D"> is the expected value or the mean across repeated samples):</p>

<p>Since the sampling error variance is always positive (unless the sample size was infinite…), there will be a positive bias in expected value of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?h_i%5E2">. It is important to note that the variance in sampling error (i.e., <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctext%7BVar%7D(e_i)">) will be larger with smaller sample sizes.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="simulated-example">Simulated Example</h2>
<p>Lets assume that in the population, the squared correlation between predicted and observed outcome (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R%5E2">) is zero, that is, the independent variables (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X_1">,<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X_2">, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X_3">) do not explain any variance in the dependent variable (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y">). Lets simulate two studies, where one study has a sample size of 100 and the other has a sample size of 25. Then lets replicate these studies 5,000 times. In the first figure we will see that the mean value of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R%5E2"> is not zero even though the population value is. And with the smaller sample sizes within each study (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N%20=%2025">), the mean <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R%5E2"> is larger. The plots below show the distribution of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R%5E2"> using the <code>ggdist</code> package <span class="citation" data-cites="kay">(Kay 2023)</span>.</p>

<p>If we were to run a meta-analysis on all 5,000 studies and found a meta-analytic average <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R%5E2"> of .13, we may conclude that there is a meaningful prediction/effect, however, this could simply be an artifact of sampling error. The plot below shows how the mean <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R%5E2"> changes as you vary the sample size.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In a meta-analysis, it is always best to use directional effect sizes that can be both positive and negative such as Cohen’s <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d">’s or Pearson correlations. There are other strategies for meta-analyzing <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R%5E2"> values such as using individual person data meta-analysis (using the raw data for each study) or meta-analyzing the correlation matrix between predictors and outcomes first and then running the regression model on the meta-analytic correlation matrix (this would not allow for non-linear terms though). If it is necessary to meta-analyze <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R%5E2"> you will want to use the adjusted <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R%5E2"> value. See the plot below that shows the adjusted <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R%5E2"> across different sample sizes</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-1-obtain-the-necessary-statistics">Step 1: Obtain the necessary statistics</h2>
<p>In order to calculate the pre/post correlation (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r">), we need the standard deviation (SD) of pre-test scores (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?SD_%7Bpre%7D">), the SD of post-test scores (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?SD_%7Bpost%7D">), the mean change (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?M_%7Bchange%7D">), the paired t-statistic (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">), the sample size (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N">). In this blog post, we are assuming that the change score standard deviation (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?SD_%7Bchange%7D">) is unavailable to us. If the pre-test SD is available, but the post-test SD is unavailable, you can approximate the post-test SD by, first, taking average ratio of the pre-test SD and post-test SD from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k"> studies in the current meta-analysis (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Coverline%7BSD%7D_%7Bratio%7D">; see the blog post on 9/8/2023), then we can approximate the post-test SD by multiplying the pre-test SD by the average SD ratio,</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0ASD_%7Bpost%7D%5Capprox%20%5Cbar%7BSD%7D_%7Bratio%7D%5Ctimes%20SD_%7Bpre%7D%0A"></p>
<p>A rougher approximation would be to simply set the pre-test SD and post-test SD to be equal. If the study reports an F-statistic from a one-way repeated measures ANOVA, the F-statistic is equal to the square of the t-statistic,</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0At%20=%20%5Csqrt%7BF%7D%0A"></p>
<p>Ensure that you apply the correct sign (negative or positive) to the t-statistic, since the F-statistic is always positive.</p>

<section id="step-2-calculate-the-prepost-correlation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-2-calculate-the-prepost-correlation">Step 2: Calculate the Pre/Post Correlation</h2>
<p>Lets start by figuring out how to find the change score SD. The paired t-statistic is defined as the mean change score divided by the standard error of change scores, such that, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0At%20=%20%5Cfrac%7BM_%7Bchange%7D%7D%7BSE_%7Bchange%7D%7D%0A"> Since we need the change score SD, we can use the definition of the standard error of the mean to put the t-statistic in terms of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?SD_%7Bchange%7D">: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0ASE_%7Bchange%7D=%5Cfrac%7BSD_%7Bchange%7D%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7BN%7D%7D%0A"> and therefore <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> can be expressed as,</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0At=%5Cfrac%7BM_%7Bchange%7D%7D%7B%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7BSD_%7Bchange%7D%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7BN%7D%7D%5Cright)%7D%0A"></p>
<p>then we just need to solve for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?SD_%7Bchange%7D">:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0ASD_%7Bchange%7D=%5Cfrac%7BM_%7Bchange%7D%5Ctimes%5Csqrt%7BN%7D%7D%7Bt%7D%0A"></p>
<p>Okay so now let us recall the definition of change score SDs from the blog post on 9/8/2023. In that blog we discussed how to obtain the pre/post correlation from the change score SD, now that we have converted <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?SD_%7Bchange%7D">, we can solve for the correlation in a similar way. First things first, the change score SD can be defined as, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0ASD_%7Bchange%7D%20=%20%5Csqrt%7BSD%5E2_%7Bpre%7D%20+%20SD%5E2_%7Bpost%7D%20-%202%5Ctimes%20r%5Ctimes%20SD_%7Bpre%7DSD_%7Bpost%7D%7D%0A"></p>
<p>We can re-arrange this to isolate the pre/post correlation (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r">),</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ar%20=%20%5Cfrac%7BSD%5E2_%7Bpre%7D%20+%20SD%5E2_%7Bpost%7D%20-%20SD%5E2_%7Bchange%7D%7D%7B2%20%5Ctimes%20SD_%7Bpre%7D%5Ctimes%20SD_%7Bpost%7D%7D%0A"></p>
<p>In our case, the study did not report the change score SD, therefore we can replace it with our derived <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?SD_%7Bchange%7D"> from a paired t-test:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ar%20=%20%5Cfrac%7BSD%5E2_%7Bpre%7D%20+%20SD%5E2_%7Bpost%7D%20-%20%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7BM_%7Bchange%7D%5Ctimes%5Csqrt%7BN%7D%7D%7Bt%7D%5Cright)%20%5E2%7D%7B2%20%5Ctimes%20SD_%7Bpre%7D%5Ctimes%20SD_%7Bpost%7D%7D%0A"> Lets neaten this formulation up a tad:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ar%20=%20%5Cfrac%7Bt%5E2%5Cleft(SD%5E2_%7Bpre%7D%20+%20SD%5E2_%7Bpost%7D%5Cright)%20-%20N%5Ctimes%20M%5E2_%7Bchange%7D%20%7D%7B2%20%5Ctimes%20t%5E2%20%5Ctimes%20SD_%7Bpre%7D%5Ctimes%20SD_%7Bpost%7D%20%7D%0A"></p>
<p>Isn’t that just a beautiful thing?? So there you have it! the full equation for the pre/post correlation from a paired t-test! Note that this is a direct conversion and not merely an approximation.</p>

<section id="inter-quantile-range" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="inter-quantile-range">Inter-Quantile Range</h3>
<p>Studies may report inter-quantile ranges in order to communicate the spread of the data. However, meta-analysts will need standard deviations (SD) to calculate effect size estimates such as standardized mean differences (i.e., Cohen’s <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d">). For this post, we will focus on the inter-<em>quartile</em> range (IQR) although the method described here will apply to any range between a pair of quantiles. The IQR (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X_%7B(75-25)%7D">) is defined as the difference between the 75th and 25th quantile values, that is, the region where 50% of the data lies. We can visualize what this will look like with normally distributed data:</p>
<div class="cell">

<p><img src="https://matthewbjane.com/blog-posts/blog-post-2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" width="672"></p>
</figure>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now let’s compare the range of values covered by +/- 1 SDs of a normal distribution:</p>

</figure>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The range covered by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cpm%201"> SD covers a considerably larger range of values than the IQR.</p>

<section id="step-2-convert-iqr-to-standard-deviations" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-2-convert-iqr-to-standard-deviations">Step 2: Convert IQR to Standard Deviations</h3>
<p>The quantile function (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cphi%5E%7B-1%7D">) of the standard normal distribution (i.e., mean=0, SD=1) converts quantiles of the cumulative density function into the corresponding values in standard deviation units. The difference between the corresponding values will give us the IQR in SD units,</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AS_%7B(75-25)%7D%20=%20%5Cphi%5E%7B-1%7D(.75)%20-%20%5Cphi%5E%7B-1%7D(.25)%0A"> The resulting value is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S_%7B(75-25)%7D=1.34898">. It is important to note that this formulation can be used for any set of quantiles not just IQR, therefore we can generalized this to compare any arbitrary pair of quantiles (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Q1,Q2">),</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AS_%7B(Q_2-Q_1)%7D%20=%20%5Cphi%5E%7B-1%7D(Q_2)%20-%20%5Cphi%5E%7B-1%7D(Q_1)%0A"></p>
<p>Now that we have the IQR in terms of SD units, we can divide with the raw IQR to obtain an estimate of the SD of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S_X">),</p>

<p>Since this method provides an approximation of a normal distribution it is important to point out that the method may be biased under different distributions. For example, if we try the same method on a Student’s t distribution with heavy tails (3.5 degrees of freedom), <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S_%7B(75-25)%7D"> would be equal to 1.50187 which is slightly larger than 1.34898 that we computed from the normal distribution. If we were to assume a normal distribution when it was truly a student’s t, the method would over-estimate the standard deviation by ~11%.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-1-obtain-pre-test-post-test-and-change-score-standard-deviations">Step 1: Obtain Pre-test, Post-test, and Change score standard deviations</h2>
<p>In order to calculate the pre/post correlation (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r">), we need an estimate of the standard deviation (SD) of pre-test scores (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S_%7Bpre%7D">), the SD of post-test scores (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S_%7Bpost%7D">), and the SD of change scores (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S_%7Bchange%7D">, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_%7Bchange%7D=x_%7Bpost%7D-x_%7Bpre%7D">). If the post-test SD is unavailable, but the pre-test SD is available, you can approximate the post-test SD by, first, taking average ratio of the pre-test SD and post-test SD from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k"> studies in the current meta-analysis,</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cbar%7BS%7D_%7Bratio%7D=%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bk%7D%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5Ek%20%5Cfrac%7BS_%7Bpost,i%7D%7D%7BS_%7Bpre,i%7D%7D%0A"> Then we can make an approximation of the post-test SD by multiplying the pre-test SD by the average SD ratio,</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AS_%7Bpost%7D%5Capprox%20%5Cbar%7BS%7D_%7Bratio%7D%5Ctimes%20S_%7Bpre%7D%0A"></p>
<p>A rougher approximation would be to simply set the pre-test SD and post-test SD to be equal.</p>

<p>The correlation between pre-test and post-test scores (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r">) can be calculated by re-arranging the equation for change score SD:</p>
