    "title": "A Statistical Interrogation of “The Case for Causality, Part 1” by Rausch and Haidt",
    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nThe article by Rausch and Haidt (R&H) conducts a re-analysis of a meta-analysis by Ferguson (2024) on RCTs assessing the causal effect (for the sake of this post, I am avoiding any causal inference issues) of social media usage on outcomes related to well-being (e.g., life satisfaction, anxiety). However, the re-analysis conducted by R&H has severe flaws. Generally speaking, if you conduct a re-analysis of any study you should be certain that the re-analysis is of higher methodological quality than the original study. That is not the case here. This blog will get a bit technical, but it is important because meta-analysis isn’t just crunching numbers across studies. There is a formal statistical model that we should adhere to to actually produce coherent and interpretable results.\nThe original meta-analysis by Ferguson (2024) is not without a number of flaws, but I think it accomplished what it set out to do. Notably, the meta-analysis was pre-registered, transparent, and had publicly available data. The only problem with the open data is that the statistics used to calculate the effect sizes (reported t-statistics, means, SDs, etc.) are completely missing from the database which makes reproducing it a lot harder.\nFerguson (2024)’s meta-analysis has a couple things that stood out to me as I was skimmed through it. It seems that all measures related to mental health and well-being are combined even if they are conceptually quite different (e.g., self-esteem and anxiety). When a study reported multiple different outcome measures, Ferguson decided to pool them together presumably to handle the dependency in effects. This is not an ideal strategy for two reasons, it assumes there is no heterogeneity between outcomes and it also loses specificity in the outcome. It would have been nice to see narrower bins of constructs meta-analyzed separately such as clinical anxiety/depression measures or life satisfaction/subjective well-being measures.\nAlso, the results convey a common misinterpretation of the estimate in a random effects meta-analysis. The meta-analytic estimate was communicated as follows:\n\nAs can be seen the overall estimate for d across studies was 0.088, which was nonsignificant and well below the SESOI (r = .10, d = 0.21).\n\nWhat does an “overall estimate for d” actually mean (note: d is the effect size, we will talk about this in the next section)? Is there a true d that we are estimating by averaging the d values from all these studies together? No. A random-effects meta-analysis is estimating the mean of true effect sizes. That is, there exists a distribution of true effects and the meta-analytic estimate conveys the central tendency. Therefore, the meta-analytic estimate can not tell you whether the the intervention produces an effect of d = .088 (lets ignore the variability in this estimate for the moment), it only tells you that the effect is d = .088, on average. Heterogeneity in effect sizes describes how wide the distribution of true effects is. You could have genuine true effects that are very positive (i.e., social media use is detrimental) and very negative (i.e., social media use is beneficial) even if the meta-analytic estimate is zero. There also could be study-level characteristics that could account for this heterogeneity, for instance, studies using a particular type of experimental design or a certain outcome shows a positive effect while others don’t.\nA side note: I also came across this sentence from Ferguson (2024)’s meta-analysis on page 3:\n\nGiven the high power of meta-analysis, almost all meta-analyses are “statistically significant.”\n\nI have heard this before but it is just not true, in general. In a random effects meta-analysis where you have both within and between study variance can give pretty wide confidence intervals and large p-values. This would be a reasonable statement if you are referring to a fixed effect meta-analysis with a large total sample size or a random effect meta-analysis with a ton of studies. Neither of which are true in this case."

    "section": "Effect Size of Interest",
    "text": "Effect Size of Interest\nFirst thing we should do is to define the effect size we are using to quantify the effect of social media on well-being related outcomes. The article by Ferguson (2024) says they used a standardized mean difference known as a Cohen’s d to quantify the difference between the post-test scores in the social media using group and the non-social media using group (or some variation of that). You may think “we should be controlling for baseline differences between treatment and control groups”, well in an RCT subject’s are randomly allocated to each group so their baseline scores should be, on average, the same. We can define a (true) effect size \\(\\delta\\) as,\n\\[\n\\delta = \\frac{\\mu_\\textrm{social} - \\mu_\\textrm{no social}}{\\sigma}\n\\tag{1}\\]\nwhere \\(\\mu_\\textrm{social}\\) and \\(\\mu_\\textrm{no social}\\) is the mean of post-test scores for the social media using group and the non-social media using group (i.e., control group), respectively. The standardizer \\(\\sigma\\) is the within-group standard deviation and it assumes that both the social media and non-social media group have the same standard deviation (probably a fine assumption 🤷). A sample estimator of the effect size will be denoted as \\(d\\) and it represents the effect size we actually observe from the results of a study,\n\\[\nd = \\frac{m_\\textrm{social} - m_\\textrm{no social}}{s_\\mathrm{pooled}},\n\\tag{2}\\]\nwhere English letters denote the sample estimators of the corresponding parameters in Equation 1. The standardizer \\(s_\\mathrm{pooled}\\) here is the pooled standard deviation. Since we only have access to the standard deviation of each group we have to pool them together to get a more precise estimate of \\(\\sigma\\) (again, we are assuming the standard deviations within both groups are equal in the population),\n\\[\ns_\\mathrm{pooled} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(n_\\textrm{social}-1)s^2_\\textrm{social} + (n_\\textrm{no social}-1)s^2_\\textrm{no social}}{n_\\textrm{social} + n_\\textrm{no social} - 2}}\n\\]\nI will note here, that there was no correction for small sample bias in the original meta-analysis as far as I could tell so I will not apply any correction here."

    "text": "Statistical Model\nUltimately, the observed effect size \\(d\\) is a sample estimate of the true effect size \\(\\delta\\) and therefore will contain error. This error is referred to as sampling error and is defined as the difference between the observed effect size and the true effect size. For a given study \\(i\\), we can relate the observed effect size \\(d_i\\) and the true effect size \\(\\delta_i\\) by including a sampling error term (\\(\\varepsilon_i\\)),\n\\[\nd_i = \\delta_i + \\varepsilon_i\n\\] where \\(\\varepsilon_i\\) is literally defined as \\(\\varepsilon_i = d_i - \\delta_i\\). The extent to which sampling errors are obscuring our effect size can be captured by the sampling variance. We can assume that sampling errors are normally distributed and evenly distributed around zero such that, \\(\\varepsilon_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,v_i)\\) where \\(v_i\\) is the sampling variance for study \\(i\\). The sampling variance for a given study is dependent on the sample size with larger samples having more precision and thus less variance. Assuming normally distributed data, the sampling variance of the standardized mean difference (Equation 2) is calculated with the following formula,\n\\[\nv = \\left(\\frac{n-1}{n-3}\\right) \\left(\\frac{n}{n_\\textrm{social}n_\\textrm{no social}}\\right)\\left( \\frac{d^2}{2n}\\right)\n\\]\nwhere \\(n=n_\\textrm{social}+n_\\textrm{no social}\\). However unfortunately, the available dataset from Ferguson (2024) did not provide the sample sizes within each group so instead we will have to assume they are equal (\\(n_\\textrm{social}=n_\\textrm{no social}\\)) and use the simplified formula,\n\\[\nv = \\left(\\frac{n-1}{n-3}\\right) \\left(\\frac{4}{n}\\right)\\left(1 + \\frac{d^2}{8}\\right)\n\\]\nNow we might expect that any variation in effect sizes across studies is attributable to variance in random sampling errors, however this is unlikely to be the case. In reality, effect sizes tend to vary across studies above and beyond what we would expect from sampling error alone. This extra variation (known as heterogeneity) in effect sizes could be due to sampling from different populations, utilizing different methodologies, using different measures, etc.\nRecall that we modeled an observed effect size as the sum of the true effect size for that study and sampling error \\(d_i = \\delta_i + \\varepsilon_i\\). We defined the distribution of sampling errors so now we can also define the distribution of true effect sizes as \\(\\delta_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_\\delta,\\tau^2)\\) where \\(\\mu_\\delta\\) is the mean of true effect sizes across studies and \\(\\tau^2\\) is the variance of true effect sizes (i.e., heterogeneity). Ultimately our goal in a meta-analysis is to estimate both \\(\\mu_\\delta\\) and \\(\\tau\\). The common misinterpretation in (random-effect) meta-analyses that I described in the introduction is that a meta-analysis is estimating a single true effect size. If there is heterogeneity (\\(\\tau^2 &gt; 0\\)) then there is a distribution of true effects that we must consider."

    "section": "Parameter estimation",
    "text": "Parameter estimation\nIn meta-analysis we are trying to estimate particular parameters (i.e., the mean \\(\\mu_\\delta\\) and variance \\(\\tau\\) of true effect sizes) just like any other statistical model. Simply averaging study effect sizes to obtain some “overall” effect size is not a principled statistical approach. This is why we went through the trouble of describing a random effects model in the previous section. We want to estimate the mean of true effect sizes (not the “overall effect size” or “the true effect size”). To estimate the mean of true effects \\(\\mu_\\delta\\) we can not just calculate the arithmetic mean of observed effect sizes. Instead we must use appropriate weights that take advantage of differential precision across studies. Particularly, we want to weight each study by the inverse variance,\n\\[\nw_i = \\frac{1}{\\tau^2 + v_i}\n\\] This will preferentially weight studies with less sampling variance (i.e., larger sample sizes). Also, since \\(\\tau^2\\) is the same for all studies, the larger \\(\\tau^2\\) is relative to \\(v_i\\) then the weights will become more equal across studies. We can then use these weights to estimate the mean true effect size by taking a weighted average of observed effect sizes across \\(k\\) studies,\n\\[\n\\hat{\\mu}_\\delta = \\frac{\\sum^k_{i=1} w_i d_i}{\\sum^k_{i=1} w_i}\n\\] where the little carrot \\(\\hat{\\cdot}\\) denotes an estimate. We can also compute the 95% confidence interval of \\(\\hat{\\mu}_\\delta\\) (the set of plausible values of the actual mean that are compatible with the data) using the Hartung, Knapp, Sidik and Jonkman method (this adjusts for poor coverage rates in small \\(k\\) meta-analyses, which is the case here),\n\\[\nCI =  \\hat{\\mu}_\\delta \\pm 1.96 \\cdot\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum^k_{i=1}w_i(d_i-\\mu_\\delta)^2}{(k-1)\\sum^k_{i=1}w_i}}\n\\]\nThe last two things we want to estimate are the variance in true effects \\(\\tau^2\\) and what is known as a prediction interval. The variance in true effects is estimated a variety of different ways and we won’t go through all of them here. Instead we will exclusively use a restricted maximum likelihood estimator (REML) which is an iterative estimation procedure. Ferguson (2024) uses a maximum likelihood estimator (ML), however ML tends to under-estimate the heterogeneity. The 95% prediction interval uses the information from \\(\\hat{\\tau}\\) to construct an interval that can be interpreted as the interval where 95% of true effect sizes fall.\n\\[\nPI = \\hat{\\mu}_\\delta \\pm 1.96 \\cdot\\hat\\tau\n\\]\nSo just keep in mind that the \\(CI\\) describes the variability in the estimate of the mean and \\(PI\\) describes the variability in the true effects."

Using the metafor package we can use the REML method for estimating the heterogeneity and the Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman method for obtaining the confidence intervals and p-values.\n\nmdl &lt;- rma(yi = d, \n           vi = v, \n           data = dat,\n           method = \"REML\",\n           test=\"knha\")\nmdl\n\n\nRandom-Effects Model (k = 27; tau^2 estimator: REML)\n\ntau^2 (estimated amount of total heterogeneity): 0.0564 (SE = 0.0230)\ntau (square root of estimated tau^2 value):      0.2374\nI^2 (total heterogeneity / total variability):   76.62%\nH^2 (total variability / sampling variability):  4.28\n\nTest for Heterogeneity:\nQ(df = 26) = 91.9083, p-val &lt; .0001\n\nModel Results:\n\nestimate      se    tval  df    pval    ci.lb   ci.ub    \n  0.0879  0.0576  1.5249  26  0.1394  -0.0306  0.2063    \n\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nWe are pretty much able to reproduce the results seen in Ferguson (2024) with slight differences probably due to having to assume equal sample sizes between groups, using a different heterogeneity estimator and using the Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman method for the confidence intervals. Let’s get the 95% prediction interval as well.\n\npredict.rma(mdl)\n\n\n   pred     se   ci.lb  ci.ub   pi.lb  pi.ub \n 0.0879 0.0576 -0.0306 0.2063 -0.4143 0.5901 \n\n\nSo, 95% of true effects fall between -.41 and .59 according to our model."

    "section": "R&H’s analysis",
    "text": "R&H’s analysis\nR&H conduct a sub-group analysis by chopping up the studies into three bins. First issue here is that this analysis is completely post-hoc and who knows if they created these bins after trying various combinations to reach the conclusion that they desired. R&H separate the 27 studies into three bins (this is verbatim from the article):\n\nMulti-week reduction experiments. These ten studies examined the impact of reducing social media use for at least two weeks, allowing withdrawal symptoms to dissipate.\nShort (one week or less) reduction experiments. These ten studies examined brief periods of abstinence from social media use, which are likely to pick up withdrawal symptoms from heavy users.\nExposure experiments. In these seven studies, the ‘treatment’ is typically brief exposure to some kind of social media, such as requiring high school students to look at their Facebook or Instagram page for 10 minutes.\n\nThe second problem we see is that the first two groups are separated by dichotomizing a naturally continuous variable (length of intervention). Sure it makes the data more digestible, but you simply lose information. This is generally considered bad statistical practice and we will see why a little later.\nTo reproduce R&H’s analysis, we will add a column to the data set that denotes the group membership (1 = Multi-week reduction experiments, 2 = One week reduction experiments, 3 = Less than one week reduction experiments, 4 = Exposure experiments) of each study.\n\ndat &lt;- dat %&gt;%\n  mutate(subgroup = c(1, # Alcott 2020\n                      1, # Brailovskaia 2020\n                      1, # Brailovskaia 2022\n                      1, # Collins and Edgers 2022\n                      4, # Deters & Mehl 2013\n                      1, # Faulhaber et al., 2023\n                      3, # Gajdics 2022\n                      1, # Hall et al. 2021\n                      1, # Hunt 2018\n                      1, # Hunt 2021\n                      2, # Kleefeld dissertation\n                      2, # Lambert 2022\n                      4, # Lepp 2022\n                      2, # Mahalingham 2023\n                      3, # Mitev 2021\n                      4, # Ozimek 2020\n                      3, # Przybylski 2021\n                      4, # Sagioglou 2014 study 2\"\n                      4, # Tartaglia\n                      1, # Thai 2021\n                      1, # Thai 2023\n                      2, # Tromholt 2016\n                      2, # Valley2019\n                      2, # van wezel 2021\n                      3, # Vanman 2018\n                      4, # Ward 2017\n                      4  # Yuen et al., 2019\n                      ))\n\n\n# display updated dataset\nhead(dat[c(\"Citation\",\"n\",\"d\",\"v\",\"subgroup\")])\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  Citation                    n      d       v subgroup\n  &lt;chr&gt;                   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Alcott 2020              1661  0.09  0.00241        1\n2 Brailovskaia 2020         286  0.154 0.0141         1\n3 Brailovskaia 2022         322  0     0.0125         1\n4 Collins and Edgers 2022   121 -0.138 0.0337         1\n5 Deters & Mehl 2013         86 -0.207 0.0479         4\n6 Faulhaber et al., 2023    230  0.484 0.0181         1\n\n\nNow that we have the subgroup column, we can conduct the sub-group analysis. Here comes the next problem, R&H decide to simply calculates the arithmetic (unweighted) mean of the observed effect sizes within each group. The problem is that they aren’t capitalizing on the fact that different studies have different levels of precision. The only way it would make sense to compute an unweighted average with respect to the statistical model we are employing is if sampling error didn’t exist (it does) or heterogeneity is infinite (its not), so either way its just the wrong approach.\nLet’s first reproduce R&H’s results by taking the unweighted average of observed effect sizes.\n\nresults &lt;- summarize(.data = dat,\n                     mean_d = mean(d),\n                     k_studies = n(),\n                     .by = subgroup)\n\n# reorder the subgroup display\nresults[c(1,4,3,2),]\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 3\n  subgroup  mean_d k_studies\n     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;int&gt;\n1        1  0.204         10\n2        2  0.0868         6\n3        3 -0.172          4\n4        4  0.0566         7\n\n\nAll the values are accurate. We can compare it to the table shown in R&H’s article:\n\nOkay we see a positive average effect for the multi-week reduction experiments, but lets now use proper inverse-variance weights to calculate the average. This time we will model the groups as dummy predictors and specify the proper contrasts for each group:\n\n# construct a meta-analytic model with subgroup\n# as a dummy-coded categorical predictor\nmdl &lt;- rma(d ~ factor(subgroup,levels = c(1,2,3,4)), \n           vi = v, \n           data = dat,\n           test=\"knha\")\n\n# acquire subgroup-level mean estimates\nestimates &lt;- as.data.frame(\n  predict(mdl, \n          rbind(g1 = c(0,0,0),\n                g2 = c(1,0,0),\n                g3 = c(0,1,0),\n                g4 = c(0,0,1))))\n\n# print results\nround(data.frame(group = 1:4, mean_delta = estimates$pred),3)\n\n  group mean_delta\n1     1      0.177\n2     2      0.154\n3     3     -0.172\n4     4      0.082\n\n\nAs we can see the estimates are a bit different. Another thing that is completely missing from the R&H analysis is any indication of variability in their mean estimates and their is no indication of heterogeneity. It is conveyed as a fixed quantity, however just because we combine many studies together does not mean that uncertainty ceases to exist.\n\nround(data.frame(group = 1:4, \n                 mean_delta = estimates$pred,\n                 CI_low = estimates$ci.lb,\n                 CI_high = estimates$ci.ub,\n                 PI_low = estimates$pi.lb,\n                 PI_high = estimates$pi.ub),3)\n\n  group mean_delta CI_low CI_high PI_low PI_high\n1     1      0.177 -0.005   0.360 -0.296   0.651\n2     2      0.154 -0.098   0.407 -0.350   0.659\n3     3     -0.172 -0.443   0.099 -0.686   0.342\n4     4      0.082 -0.151   0.315 -0.414   0.577\n\n\nTrue effects for group 1 (multi-week reduction studies, i.e., the focal group) are quite variable and can range from -0.296 to 0.651. An interesting point to bring up is that Ferguson (2024) set the smallest effect size of interest (SESOI) to be d = .21 in his pre-registration (equivalent to a Pearson correlation of r = .10). However, that does not help us much here since the upper bound of the confidence interval is well above d = .21 so you can’t really make the claim that that there is no clinically meaningful effect, on average. And you definitely can’t make the claim that all/most true effects are not clinically meaningful since the upper bound of the PI is 0.651. Truthfully, the SESOI established in Ferguson (2024) does not seem to have any good theoretical or practical justification outside of “seems reasonable” so it is unclear what the utility of this arbitrary boundary is in this case?"

It is a valid data point and piece of evidence that should not be taken out of the analysis post-hoc. Hell, it could be that the the positive effect of not being on social media only lasts a few weeks and then fades out (not an uncommon trend in psychology interventions). Anyways, any reason to remove that “outlier” would seem to me like a post-hoc rationalization."

    "text": "Discussion\nThe re-analysis of Ferguson (2024)’s meta-analysis by R&H does not have adequate statistical rigor to build a “case for causality”. Post-hoc subgroup analyses conducted by R&H did not use a principled statistical model, they did not report any variability in their estimates, the estimates themselves were sub-optimal (unweighted averaging), and they misinterpreted the point-estimates that they calculated. They did not do a proper comparison of their point-estimates and instead they treated them as fixed quantities and simply claimed that these average effect sizes are different without consideration of variability in their estimation procedure. Their conclusion claimed that:\n\nwe still found that his data supports (rather than undermines) the contention by some scholars that “reductions in social media time would improve adolescent mental health,” at least as long as the reductions continue for two weeks or longer.\n\nBased on my re-analysis of R&H’s re-analysis I find that the intervention length when modeled properly as a continuous variable (since it literally is) does not support this claim.\nIf I did anything incorrectly or if I did not use best practices, I take full responsibility and you can let me know by sending me a DM on twitter or emailing me at matthewbjane@gmail.com."

Note that a strict operationalist in the form that I discuss in this blog post is a sort of extreme operationalist. In the measurement error modeling section, I also describe a laxed operationalist, but it is just a useful descriptor for contrasting two types of operationalist measurement models.\nA respectful operationalist is an operationalist that defines the measurand in terms of the test, but the test is validated for extra-operational meanings and usability (i.e., meanings and usability beyond the test, Vessonen 2021). So the respectful operationalist is kind of like “sure, yeah we can define the measurand in terms of the test, but the test needs to incorporate common connotations of the target concept and produce usable scores”."

This view of validity is centered around construct validity.\nA (strict) operationalist need not validate a measure, even if the measure is nonsensical, the measurand is still defined by the test.\nA respectful operationalist can validate a measure using a similar approach to Michael T. Kane’s argument-based approach to validity in which he guides researchers to specify and justify the intended use of the measure. Specifically, Vessonen (2021) proposes that a test is valid if the test incorporates common extra-operational connotations of the target concept. This will be more closely related to test-related types of validity such as content and criterion validity."

    "section": "Operationalist and Realist Measurement Error Models",
    "text": "Operationalist and Realist Measurement Error Models\nOkay let’s start at the foundation: we observe a test score \\(X_p\\) for a person, \\(p\\).\nA strict operationalist may simply define a person’s true score \\(T_p\\) as the observed score such that, \\(T_p = X_p\\). Trivially, the observed score can be modeled as the true score,\n\\[\nX_p = T_p\n\\tag{1}\\]\nThere is something attractive and so practical about this model, however there are immediate problems of usability. What if we test that person again and they obtain a different score? What if the scoring is done by a rater and a different rater assigns a different score to that person? To answer this, let us use an example where a person’s true score is defined as the observed score \\(X_{par}\\), for person \\(p\\), test administration \\(a\\), and rater \\(r\\) such that,\n\\[\nT_p = X_{par}\n\\]\nHowever the problem now is that if the observed score varies across test-administrations and/or raters then the true score will not be generalizable across test-administrations or raters,\n\\[\nT_p = X_{par} \\neq X_{pa(r+1)} \\neq X_{p(a+1)r}\n\\]\nThis will force us to define a true score for not only each person, but also each test administration and rater such that,\n\\[\nT_{par} = X_{par}.\n\\]\nHowever differences in observed scores between test-administration and raters may not be of scientific interest if we only really care about person-level differences. This specific operationalist approach is simply unusable in practice. Although, it is interesting to note, that the reliability of observed scores is necessarily perfect and can be shown by the reliability index, \\(\\rho_{XT}=1\\) (i.e., the correlation between true and observed scores).\nA more laxed operationalist definition of true scores would be to define it based on the expectation of observed scores conditional on a person. Therefore a definition of a true score for a given person can be expressed by,\n\\[\nT_p = \\mathbb{E}[X_{par}\\mid p]\n\\]\nConditional expectation (\\(\\mathbb{E}[\\cdot]\\)) is the average observed score over all possible observed scores for a given person. This also provides the beautiful property that \\(X_{p}\\) for a given person, is calibrated to \\(T_p\\), since,\n\\[\nT_p -  \\mathbb{E}[X_p\\mid p] = T_p - T_p =  0.\n\\]\nSo now, even if observed scores vary across raters and/or test administrations, the true score will remain constant. The question at this point is how can we model a single instance of an observed score. Here, we will need to introduce measurement errors. Measurement errors can be defined as differences between observed scores and true scores. Remember that in our strict operationalist model (Equation 1) we did not have any measurement errors since the true score was equivalent to the observed score (i.e., if \\(T_p = X_p\\), then \\(T_p - X_p = 0\\)). Now that the true score is the conditional expectation of the observed score, a single instance of an observed score can differ from the true score. We can thus add a new term to the model described in Equation 1,\n\\[\nX_{p} = T_p + E_{p},\n\\tag{2}\\]\nwhere \\(E_{p}\\) indicates the error in the observed score for a given person and measurement. Since we started with the definition of true scores being \\(T_p = \\mathbb{E}[X \\mid  p]\\), an extremely useful consequence of this is that the conditional expectation of measurement errors within a person is zero. We can demonstrate why this is the case with a short derivation (first re-arranging Equation 2 so that \\(E_{p}\\) is on the left hand side),\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\mathbb{E}[E_{p}\\mid p] &= \\mathbb{E}[T_p -  X_p\\mid p] \\\\[.3em]\n&= \\mathbb{E}[T_p\\mid p] -  \\mathbb{E}[X_p\\mid p] \\\\[.3em]\n&= T_p -  T_p \\\\[.3em]\n&= 0 \\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\nErrors that balance out over all possible observed scores for a given person is what distinguishes the classical test theory model from other measurement models (Kroc and Zumbo 2020). It is important to note that the algebraic formulation of \\(X=T+E\\) is not what defines the classical test theory model, in fact, many measurement error models come in an analogous form. It is the conditional expectations between the components of the model which distinguish classical errors from other measurement error models (e.g., Berkson errors, see Kroc and Zumbo 2020).\nA realist model may suppose that the true score is a construct score that is an objective value that is defined outside of the measurement operations (the actual value of the construct/attribute being measured; Borsboom and Mellenbergh (2002)). Therefore we can not define true scores in terms of observed scores without knowing how observed scores are calibrated true scores. The realist model for an observed score is superficially identical to Equation 2,\n\\[\nX_{p} = T_p + E_{p},\n\\tag{3}\\]\nwith the major difference being that \\(\\mathbb{E}[X|p] \\neq T_p\\). Note that Equation 3 is not the classical test theory model because it does not, by default, meet the assumptions of classical test theory that the laxed operationalist model does (Equation 2). The big difference between this realist model the laxed operationalist model is that the conditional expectation of errors is no longer zero in the realist approach, and thus systematic errors (i.e., biased estimates of true scores) can exist. In order to recover proper calibration of the observed scores to true scores, we would have to just assume that \\(\\mathbb{E}[E_p\\mid p]=0\\) (see flaws below).\nWhen it comes to psychological constructs the realist approach has two major flaws to me.\n\nNecessitates the existence of a construct score that is independent of the measure. Without sufficient evidence of a construct existing, we are adding additional complexity to our theory. Therefore it adds increased complexity into our theory.\nEven if the construct is real and has a true construct score, we have no idea how the observed scores are calibrated to those true scores. The operationalist model produces a calibrated measure by definition whereas the realist model needs to add an additional assumption (i.e., conditioned on a given person, the expectation of measurement errors is zero) in order for the observed scores to be calibrated.\n\nThe operationalist model may have the biggest flaw so far:\n\nSince the measurand is defined by the measure itself, you can not really draw any meaningful inferences about anything outside of the measure.\n\nThere is a third option though!"

We generally have inter-subjective agreement about the meanings of concepts like intelligence, anxiety, and depression mean outside of the measurement instrument. We can imagine that items contain content that are more or less related to those inter-subjective meanings. The extent to which the item content is relevant to the concept of interest reflects the item’s content validity. The true score can be defined as the conditional expectation of observed scores obtained from tests containing items that are sufficiently valid (this could be done from inter-rater assessment of the conceptual relatedness of items and concepts) can define the true scores. that contain sufficient validity. Let’s define an observed score produced by a sufficiently valid test as \\(X_p^\\star\\). As an example, a measure of depression that produces observed scores from responses to the question, “what is your age?”, would not encompass common connotations of depression and therefore those observed scores would not in the set of valid observed scores.

Currently, I am not sufficiently convinced this is the case this is the case for most (if not all) psychological constructs; therefore, I am not comfortable making the commitments necessary to take on a realist position.

    "section": "What is Meta-regression?",
    "text": "What is Meta-regression?\nMeta-regression is a modeling approach used in meta-analysis to see how effect sizes vary across studies. For example, let’s say we want to know the effect of some drug on disease remission, but the effect sizes are highly heterogenous (studies use different methods, sample from different populations, etc. and thus have different estimands). We may want to know what aspects of these studies cause differences in their resulting effects? If different studies use a different doseage amount then we may hypothesize that dose will account for some of that heterogeneity in effects. Doseage is what we would call a moderator of the effect size (moderator is analogous to a predictor in a traditional regression). Meta-regression is like any regression model with the only difference that the data points represent entire studies and that studies are weighted such that more precise studies (i.e., larger sample sizes/smaller standard errors) are preferentially weighted. The regression line will estimate the conditional mean effect size.\nLet’s visualize this example by running a meta-regression and creating a bubble plot (a scatter plot, but the data points are sized relative to the precision of the study). The effect size is the log risk ratio between treatment and control groups,\n\\[\n\\ln RR = \\ln \\frac{p_T}{p_C},\n\\] where \\(p_T\\) and \\(p_C\\) are the proportions of individuals in remission within the treatment and control group, respectively. We will then see how the doseage moderates the \\(\\ln RR\\) across studies. In R, we can use the metafor (Viechtbauer 2010) package to fit a meta-regression.\n\n\nShow the code\nlibrary(metafor)\n\ndat &lt;- escalc(measure = \"RR\",\n              # data set loaded in from metafor package\n              data = dat.viechtbauer2021,\n              # treatment/control number of people in remission\n              ai = xTi, ci = xCi,\n              # treatment/control group sample size in\n              n1 = nTi, n2 = nCi,\n              # label effect size and sampling variance (se^2)\n              var.names = c(\"lnRR\", \"v\"))\n\n# fit model\nmdl &lt;- rma(lnRR ~ dose, \n           vi = v,\n           data = dat)\n\n# plot model\nregplot(mdl,refline = 0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see a very strong relationship between the effect size and the dosage amount."

    "section": "What would a meta-analytic GAM look like?",
    "text": "What would a meta-analytic GAM look like?\nThis brief intro section is a sort of a meta-analytic adaptation of a section of Michael Clark’s online text “Generalized Additive Models”.\nIn our example, we used a linear meta-regression so let us define a simple linear meta-regression model mathematically. An observed (arbitrary) effect size \\(d_i\\) from study \\(i\\) is expressed as,\n\\[\nd_i = \\underset{_\\textrm{intercept}}{b_0} + \\overset{^\\textrm{moderator effect}}{b_1M_i} + \\underset{_\\textrm{true effect variability}}{u_i} + \\overset{^\\textrm{sampling error}}{\\varepsilon_i}.\n\\] The first three terms in the equation is what defines the true effect size \\(\\delta_i\\) for study \\(i\\) and the last term denotes sampling error which is what distinguishes the observed effect size \\(d_i\\) from the true effect size \\(\\delta_i\\). The true effect size is conditionally distributed as,\n\\[\n\\delta_i \\mid M_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(b_0 + b_1M_i\\, ,\\, \\tau^2\\right)\n\\] Where \\(\\tau^2\\) is the residual variance in true effects (i.e., \\(\\tau^2 = \\mathrm{var}(u_i)\\)). We can see that the conditional expectation of true effects is a linear function of the moderator variable \\(\\mathbb{E}[\\delta_i \\mid M] = b_0 + b_1M_i\\). But we don’t have to model the conditional mean as linear. If the data appears non-linear we can instead model it as some smooth function \\(f\\) such that the conditional mean has some non-linear functional form,\n\\[\n\\delta_i \\mid M_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(f(M_i),\\, \\tau^2\\right).\n\\]\nFor GAMs we elect to choose a space of functions (e.g., cubic splines) called a basis. A function within the function space can be expressed as a linear combination of basis functions. Essentially, we want to estimate this “big” function with with a series of known “smaller” functions. For our case, the function \\(f(M_i)\\) can be expressed as, \\(f(M_i) = \\sum^m_{q=1} b_q\\xi_q(M_i)\\), where \\(\\xi_q\\) are basis functions. Therefore the conditional distribution of true effects is now given by,\n\\[\n\\delta_i \\mid M_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\sum^m_{q=1} b_q\\xi_q(M_i),\\, \\tau^2\\right).\n\\]\nThe conditional expectation of true effects now can have a lot of flexibility. Note that we do not want to try to interpret the regression coefficients \\(b_q\\) of those smaller basis functions, instead we want to interpret the bigger function which is estimating the conditional mean of true effects. To estimate the conditional expectation, GAMs utilize penalized splines which penalizes the function for being too “wiggly” so as to maintain a parsimonious model. The number of knots (i.e., the joints/abscissa of the “big” function) also does not have to be set manually like they do in other spline models."

In this blog post, we are assuming that the change score standard deviation (\\(SD_{change}\\)) is unavailable to us.

The paired t-statistic is defined as the mean change score divided by the standard error of change scores, such that, \\[\nt = \\frac{M_{change}}{SE_{change}}\n\\] Since we need the change score SD, we can use the definition of the standard error of the mean to put the t-statistic in terms of \\(SD_{change}\\): \\[\nSE_{change}=\\frac{SD_{change}}{\\sqrt{N}}\n\\] and therefore \\(t\\) can be expressed as,\n\\[\nt=\\frac{M_{change}}{\\left(\\frac{SD_{change}}{\\sqrt{N}}\\right)}\n\\]\nthen we just need to solve for \\(SD_{change}\\):\n\\[\nSD_{change}=\\frac{M_{change}\\times\\sqrt{N}}{t}\n\\]\nOkay so now let us recall the definition of change score SDs from the blog post on 9/8/2023. In that blog we discussed how to obtain the pre/post correlation from the change score SD, now that we have converted \\(t\\) to \\(SD_{change}\\), we can solve for the correlation in a similar way. First things first, the change score SD can be defined as, \\[\nSD_{change} = \\sqrt{SD^2_{pre} + SD^2_{post} - 2\\times r\\times SD_{pre}SD_{post}}\n\\]\nWe can re-arrange this to isolate the pre/post correlation (\\(r\\)),\n\\[\nr = \\frac{SD^2_{pre} + SD^2_{post} - SD^2_{change}}{2 \\times SD_{pre}\\times SD_{post}}\n\\]\nIn our case, the study did not report the change score SD, therefore we can replace it with our derived \\(SD_{change}\\) from a paired t-test:\n\\[\nr = \\frac{SD^2_{pre} + SD^2_{post} - \\left(\\frac{M_{change}\\times\\sqrt{N}}{t}\\right) ^2}{2 \\times SD_{pre}\\times SD_{post}}\n\\] Lets neaten this formulation up a tad:\n\\[\nr = \\frac{t^2\\left(SD^2_{pre} + SD^2_{post}\\right) - N\\times M^2_{change} }{2 \\times t^2 \\times SD_{pre}\\times SD_{post} }\n\\]\nIsn’t that just a beautiful thing??

    "text": "Defining a Squared Effect Size\nSometimes squared effect sizes are used in order to interpret results (e.g., \\(R^2\\), \\(\\eta^2\\)). However these squared indices are biased in small sample sizes. To see why this is the case we can describe the mathematically. Generally, lets say we have some observed effect size \\(h_i\\) for a sample \\(i\\). This can be modeled as a function of a population correlation \\(\\theta\\) and sampling error \\(e_i\\),\n\\[\nh_i = \\theta + e_i\n\\]\nWhere the expectation of \\(h_i\\) (i.e., the average) upon repeated sampling is equal to \\(\\theta\\). More importantly for us, the expectation of sampling error \\(e_i\\) across repeated samples would be zero. For the expectation of \\(e_i\\) to be zero, \\(e\\) would need to be randomly distributed around zero with both positive and negative values. Let us see what happens to the model once we square both sides to obtain \\(h^2\\):\n\\[\nh^2_i = (\\theta + e_i)^2\n\\]\nand thus,\n\\[\nh^2_i = \\theta^2 + 2\\theta e_i + e_i^2\n\\]\nThe squared effect sizes is now no longer an unbiased estimate of theta. The bias in \\(h_i^2\\) can be seen by taking the expected value of both sides (note that the \\(\\text{Var}(e_i)\\) is the sampling error variance and \\(\\mathbb{E}[\\cdot]\\) is the expected value or the mean across repeated samples):\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\mathbb{E}[h^2_i] & = \\mathbb{E}[\\theta^2 + 2\\theta e_i + e_i^2] \\\\[.5em]\n                & = \\theta^2 + 2\\theta \\times \\mathbb{E}[e_i] + \\mathbb{E}[e^2_i]\\\\[.5em]\n                & = \\theta^2 + \\mathbb{E}[e_i^2] \\\\[.5em]\n                & = \\theta^2 + \\left(\\text{Var}[e_i] + \\mathbb{E}[e_i]^2\\right) \\\\[.5em]\n                & = \\theta^2 + \\text{Var}[e_i] \\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\nSince the sampling error variance is always positive (unless the sample size was infinite…), there will be a positive bias in expected value of \\(h_i^2\\). It is important to note that the variance in sampling error (i.e., \\(\\text{Var}(e_i)\\)) will be larger with smaller sample sizes."

There are other strategies for meta-analyzing \\(R^2\\) values such as using individual person data meta-analysis (using the raw data for each study) or meta-analyzing the correlation matrix between predictors and outcomes first and then running the regression model on the meta-analytic correlation matrix (this would not allow for non-linear terms though). If it is necessary to meta-analyze \\(R^2\\) you will want to use the adjusted \\(R^2\\) value.

In reality, I actually think that social media probably does have an average negative effect on mental health. I also probably agree that the RCTs in this meta-analysis probably won’t find any convincing causal estimates. If Rausch and Haidt’s (R&H) made the argument that there is a causal effect, but the RCTs won’t capture then I would have never made my original post. What I know is meta-analysis, not the literature on social media use and mental health. I was motivated to write the original post because of the clear statistical malpractice employed in R&H’s re-analysis. I have no desire to prove or disprove whether social media is actually detrimental to mental health, but I do have a desire to combat the spread of misleading analyses and poor statistical practice.\nAlso, to those absurd comments and emails out there saying that I am somehow working for big Pharma, social media companies, the government, or profiting on some misinformation campaign: I am literally a graduate student who lives with my parents to save money on rent (you can help me out by buying me a coffee). I do this because I truly believe in the fight for a rigorous, open, and transparent science. I have been very critical of how academia operates and I hope to make some positive change to that end.

I think these are completely valid points and I will conduct that analysis in this blog post.\nR&H responded to one of my last analyses in the post (regressing the effect size on length of intervention) and said the following:\n\na blog post by Matthew Jané used Ferguson’s numbers and concluded that there is no relationship between the duration of reduction and the effect size.\n\nThis is all true (with the slight quibble that I said “little/no” relationship) and I should have been clearer about the assumptions underlying my claim. In my original post I said this:\n\nOkay so as it turns out there appears to be little/no effect of the length of the intervention on the effect size.\n\nI really should have said this:\n\nGiven the proposed model and the data, there appears to be little/no effect of the length of the intervention on the effect size.\n\nUsually that does not need to be said considering the model was defined, but it is important nonetheless, since if I were to choose a different model it is possible we could have see a relationship between the two variables."

If done correctly, the analysis shows that reducing social media has no effect. *then it links to my blog post as a source*\n\nAlthough the first sentence I believe is accurate, the second sentence is not true and I did not state that in the original post. Therefore I am okay that the community note was taken down for whatever reason. Then promptly, a better and even more recent community note was posted that read,\n\nThe reanalysis doesn’t use an appropriate statistical model. It simply calculates an unweighted average across different studies, doesn’t provide confidence intervals, and misinterprets the evidence\n\nAll these points are unequivocally true. However, Haidt then posted the following tweet,\n\nThis tweet seemed to get his followers to rate the community note as unhelpful and thus it was taken down again. Of course, it is difficult to maintain a community note with Haidt’s large following. So I guess we will have to treat these blog posts as a much more detailed community note."

Let me be clear, R&H’s analysis consisted of 1) averaging results across studies and 2) counting up positive, negative, and null effects, both of which are just different obsolete and unacceptable methods of meta-analysis (the latter is commonly referred to as a vote-counting meta-analysis). If you are unconvinced, here is the definition of a meta-analysis from the Cochrane handbook:\n\nMeta-analysis is the statistical combination of results from two or more separate studies.\n\nIf you simply calculate an average effect size across studies, you have conducted a meta-analysis. If you tally up the number of positive and negative results, you have conducted a meta-analysis. Every table in R&H’s article is literally displaying a meta-analysis, whether that was their intent or not.\nOn top of all of the fundamental flaws in their analysis, R&H also based the following claim on their meta-analytic results:\n\nThese results clearly indicate that multi-week social media reduction experiments improve some aspects of well-being\n\nTheir results absolutely do not clearly indicate this. This is an extremely misleading conclusion that is based on a completely inappropriate analysis.\nI recommend that R&H remove the tables with meta-analytic results and all the conclusions/claims associated with those results. Adding a postscript, a preface, and changing the title does not fix this."

If the data is untrustworthy why conduct any analysis in the first place? Why is it more justifiable to compute unweighted average effects without any indicator of variability from that data base? If they believe that the data is untrustworthy, why conduct the analysis at all? If we decide to conduct an analysis, we must do it using the appropriate statistical techniques. Like I said previously, if R&H retracted their re-analysis and instead argued that these RCTs do not properly capture the causal effects of social media on mental health, I would probably agree with them.\nI do not have the time to double check all the effect sizes of Ferguson’s meta-analysis. I analyzed them at face value which is exactly what R&H did in their re-analyses."

In a future post we plan to do a review of the evidence from scratch so that we avoid these many problems. (It’s worth noting that we have also found five additional multi-week reduction studies, all of which find benefits to reduction, which are not in Ferguson’s meta).\n\nTo Jonathan Haidt: I would love to offer my help as a collaborator/consultant for this upcoming project so that we can establish a systematic, transparent, reproducible, and rigorous review, and meta-analysis plan. I also know many awesome and knowledgeable meta-analysts that I would be happy to recommend to you.

From my reading of the paper, the treatment group did demonstrate lower screen time for facebook, instagram, and snapchat, however higher for instant messaging apps, news/media, gaming, as well as overall screen time. R&H mention WhatsApp as one of the primary apps that people replaced social media with. It does not seem that people really consider instant messaging like WhatsApp a form of social media (see poll results below):\n\nIt does not seem clear to me that this is a failed manipulation check, especially considering total digital screen time is not the target intervention variable. R&H also mention there is no evidence that other social media apps were used:\n\nIn addition, there is no evidence that participants reduced their use of other social media platforms such as TikTok, YouTube, Twitter, and Reddit (all of which were widely used by college students in 2019).\n\nHowever that is true for a lot of the other studies in this meta-analysis where screen time wasn’t even monitored or monitored with self-report rather than more objective measures. I do not think we should punish one study for being transparent and providing a manipulation check.\nAlthough I am against the exclusion of Collis and Eggers (2022) in principle, I will nevertheless fit the regression model with and without it."

    "text": "Non-linear model with and without Collis & Eggers (2022)\nIn my blog post, I regressed the effect size on length of the intervention using a linear meta-regression which estimates the conditional mean effect size with a straight line. I have had a number of people request that weeks should be logged (which will pull in that Collis and Egger study) and fit a non-linear basis spline to the effects. I totally agree with this approach. Essentially we are modeling the conditional mean of the effect size as a non-linear function of the length of weeks. This will help account for the withdrawal effect that R&H had mentioned.\nLet’s first fit the model with the Collis and Egger (2022) included in the data:\n\nnu = 3\n\n# model with basis spline over log(weeks)\nmdl_weeks &lt;- rma(d ~ bs(log(length_weeks), df = nu),\n                 vi = v,\n                 data = dat,\n                 method = \"REML\",\n                 test = \"knha\")\n\nWarning: 7 studies with NAs omitted from model fitting.\n\n\nThe output of the model will be difficult to interpret so we will go ahead and plot it out with the confidence and prediction intervals.\n\n\nWarning: Removed 7 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we kind of would have expected, you see an initial increase in the conditional mean and then a slow fall over time. Still there is a lot of variability both in the true effects (prediction interval) and in the conditional mean effect (confidence interval) so it is difficult to say anything here with much confidence. Now we can construct the same model with Collis and Eggers (2022) removed from the analysis.\n\ndat_no_CollisEggers &lt;- dat %&gt;%\n  filter(Citation != \"Collins and Edgers 2022\")\n\nnu = 3\nmdl_weeks &lt;- rma(d ~ bs(log(length_weeks), df = nu),\n                 vi = v,\n                 data = dat_no_CollisEggers,\n                 method = \"REML\",\n                 test = \"knha\")\n\nWarning: 7 studies with NAs omitted from model fitting.\n\n\nLike we did for the last one, we can plot out the same model without the Collis and Egger (2022) study:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurprisingly, even without Collis and Egger’s study there really isn’t a whole lot we can say here with confidence. It does not really even appear is much different than it is with Collis and Eggers (2022) study included. In fact, with the predictions (conditional means) plotted side by side they appear almost identical:\n\n\n\n\n\nModel predictions (conditional mean of true effects) and confidence intervals for the model including Collis & Egger and the model without.\n\n\n\n\n\nA note on effect dependency\nThe confidence and prediction intervals are probably narrower then what it should be since some of the studies clearly come from the same lab and have similar designs. These CIs are likely the best case scenario."

    "text": "Changing the two week cut-point of R&H’s\nBrenton Wiernik suggested that I play around with the two week cut-point that R&H used in their article. I understand R&H had the following justification for their cut-point,\n\nAcute withdrawal symptoms typically peak after a few days, but often last for up to two weeks.\n\nTherefore R&H selected for reduction studies that were two weeks or longer. But if withdrawal symptoms last for two weeks in many cases, then maybe we should play it safe and only select the studies that are longer than two weeks (\\(X_\\mathrm{weeks}&gt;2\\) rather than \\(X_\\mathrm{weeks}\\geq 2\\)). This cut-point could have easily been argued with R&H’s reasoning.\n\nmdl_2weeks &lt;- rma(yi = d,\n                 vi = v,\n                 data = dat,\n                 method = \"REML\",\n                 test = \"knha\",\n                 subset = length_weeks &gt; 2)\n\npredict(mdl_2weeks)\n\n\n   pred     se   ci.lb  ci.ub   pi.lb  pi.ub \n 0.0980 0.0514 -0.0448 0.2408 -0.0448 0.2408 \n\n\nAfter playing it safe and allowing for withdrawal symptoms to subside we see a mean effect of \\(\\hat{\\mu}_\\delta = .098\\, [-.045,\\, .241]\\). Well seems that the average effect is quite small and about half the size of R&H’s average, but maybe we can try only studies that were more than 3 weeks,\n\nmdl_3weeks &lt;- rma(yi = d,\n                 vi = v,\n                 data = dat,\n                 method = \"REML\",\n                 test = \"knha\",\n                 subset = length_weeks &gt; 3)\n\npredict(mdl_3weeks)\n\n\n   pred     se   ci.lb  ci.ub   pi.lb  pi.ub \n 0.0446 0.0910 -1.1122 1.2015 -1.5739 1.6631 \n\n\nWe see the mean effect of \\(\\hat{\\mu}_\\delta = .045\\, [-1.112, \\, 1.202]\\) is even smaller with very extremely wide CIs.\nThis goes to show that arbitrary post-hoc analytic decisions can greatly impact the end result. This is just another reason why R&H’s analysis was, at the very least, highly misleading."

    "text": "Effect sizes are indices that help researchers, stakeholders, and policymakers understand the relationship between variables and draw meaningful conclusions from data. However, the usefulness of an effect size is only as good as its estimation. To ensure the accuracy of effect size estimates, it is important to mitigate the attenuation induced by various statistical artifacts, such as measurement error and range restriction. This page provides documentation on these artifacts and provides corrections that can be applied to attenuated effect sizes to obtain unbiased estimates of the true population effect size. Equations and R code are provided for each correction. For additional information on these corrections and their application in meta-analysis, consult the book by Hunter and Schmidt (1990) and the paper by Wiernik and Dahlke (2020) . The {psychmeta} package (Dahlke and Wiernik 2019) contains many of these corrections with convenient implementation in R."
