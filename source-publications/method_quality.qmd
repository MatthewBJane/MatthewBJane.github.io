abstract: "This chapter focuses on the role of methodological quality in the conduct of research in health psychology and closely allied scientific fields. There is a broad portfolio of methodological tools scientists may choose to study their phenomena and discover signals amidst the noise of reality. The only sure thing is that no method is perfect; therefore, there has never been a perfect study. Hence, converging operations are crucial to determine what is true about the phenomenon. Likewise, qualitative research may yield insights that quantitative cannot (and vice versa); thus, use of mixed-methods holds great promise. We endorse the view that methodological quality hinges on the question being asked A causal linkage is best investigated in randomized controlled trials or in systematic reviews of such trials. A phenomenological question is best addressed using qualitative or mixed-methods designs. Some conclusions cannot be reached with great confidence without the collaborative efforts of independent scientific teams conducting numerous studies; external validity is one of these, determining how robustly conclusions generalize across diverse ecologies and populations. In turn, syntheses of research such as systematic reviews, meta-analyses, meta-syntheses, and mixed-methods systematic reviews are crucial. At its best, research on health psychology will continue to compile a holistic picture of human functioning and dysfunction. We believe it can best achieve these aims by drawing from the breadth of available methodologies, all while remaining open-minded to the conceptual possibilities regarding the phenomenon in question."
