## Bio

Current PhD student interested in quantitative methods for meta-analysis and psychological measurement. Specifically, my current research projects focus on correcting bias in effect size estimates caused by statistical artifacts. I am affiliated with the Systematic Health Action Research Program (SHARP) at the University of Connecticut where I am advised by Dr. Blair T. Johnson. I am also on the editorial board for Psychological Bulletin as a methodological reviewer.
