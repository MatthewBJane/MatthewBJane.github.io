I provide three main types of consulting services: statistical consulting, data visualization, and academic website development.

If you're interested in learning more about how I can assist with your projects or if you have questions or require advice, please don't hesitate to reach out. I offer a free 20-minute consultation to discuss your specific needs and determine how I can best support you. To schedule this consultation, feel free to contact me at consulting@matthewbjane.com. I will be pleased to support you every step of the way.

## Statistical Consulting Services

I offer a wide array of services designed to cater to a broad spectrum of statistical needs, whether you're an academic or part of the industry. Here's a detailed list of the services I provide:

- Meta-analysis
- Data-analysis
- Data cleaning and management
- Statistical Modeling
- Statistical Software
- Psychometrics and Structural Equation Modeling
- R Programming
- Computationally Reproducible and Self-Contained Manuscripts


I've structured my pricing to accommodate different client types, ensuring a transparent and cost-effective approach. The current hourly rates are as follows:

|Client Type| Rate |
|:---|:--:|
|Non-Academic (Industry)|$150/hr|
|Academic|$130/hr|
|Student|$90/hr|

: {.hover}

Projects with a substantial scope (i.e., more than 20 hours worth of consulting work) can be structured so that their pricing will be done on a per-project rather than a per-hour basis.

## Data Visualization Services

I can help you prepare high-quality data visualizations for academic publications, websites, slideshows, etc. There are two types of data visualizations that I provide: stand-alone diagrams and computationally reproducible figures.

To ensure that your specific needs are met, you can either send me a detailed description of the desired diagram via email (consulting@matthewbjane.com) with the following information:

1. What kind of figure do you need?
2. When do you realistically need to have it ready by?
3. Do you have all the information needed to produce the figure?
4. Could you provide an example of a figure you are trying to emulate?

Then we can set up a free 20-minute virtual meeting to discuss the details further.

### Diagrams 

Stand-alone diagrams are used as visual representations of a scientific concept. Each diagram I produce will be made available as a high-resolution PNG, JPEG, and SVG file. For your convenience I included an example of my work below . 

|Client Type| Rate |
|:---|:--:|
|Non-Academic (Industry)|$150/diagram|
|Academic|$120/diagram|
|Student|$80/diagram|

### Computationally Reproducible Figure Panels

I can also help you generate figure panels that contain real or simulated data. For each panel, my service ensures that you will receive the final visual representation (as a high-resolution PNG or JPG), but also an R script containing the code for reproducing the figure. For your convenience, I've included examples of my work, showcasing both a two-panel figure (top) and a single-panel figure (bottom).

|Client Type| Rate |
|:---|:--:|
|Non-Academic (Industry)|$150/panel|
|Academic|$130/panel|
|Student|$100/panel|
